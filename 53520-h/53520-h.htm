<h2>THE AUTHOR'S DESK BOOK</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a id="RELATIONS_OF_THE_AUTHOR_TO_THE_PUBLISHER"></a>RELATIONS OF THE AUTHOR
TO THE PUBLISHER</h2>

<p class="dropcap">THERE is much which is intangible in the
relations between an author and his publisher.
While it is true that modern commercialism
has invaded this field as it has all others, there
are probably no actual business relations more
dependent upon mutual confidence than those
which exist between the writer who produces
a manuscript which he wishes to have published,
and a publisher who wishes to secure
for the purpose of publication a manuscript which
he believes to contain elements of probable success.
This is due to many reasons, the first
and most important of all being that each is
in a position to add to his reputation and success
by the efforts of the other. Many a
publisher has by legitimate and judicious
business sagacity established the reputation
of a previously-unknown author; many an
author has placed a small publishing-house in
a position of importance, or added to the fame
of a house already established.</p>

<p>Another reason for these closely-identified
interests is the fact that the average writer is
not experienced in business matters, but relies
largely upon the integrity of the publisher to
whom he intrusts himself. For the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
reason, the publisher feels an added responsibility
to protect the interests of the author,
realizing the fact that he has been placed in
the position of agent, to conduct affairs in the
joint interests of both. Even if there have
been cases where this confidence has been misplaced,
they are exceptions which do not affect
the general statement.</p>

<p>The fact that the average author is not versed
in business detail has brought into being the
literary agent,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who offers to stand between
the author and his so-called natural enemy,
the publisher. There is no doubt that frequently
the efforts of these literary agents
result in temporary pecuniary advantage to
the author, but the common consensus of
opinion is that in the long run the author will
best serve his own ends by co-operating with
his publisher, rather than by employing any
intermediary. Confidence begets confidence,
and fair play invites a personal interest which
is an asset, the value of which cannot be
over-estimated. When a manuscript has been
offered competitively, and is finally secured by
the highest-bidding publisher, it by no means
follows that the net returns from this contract
will exceed or equal what the author might
have received through some other publisher,
better equipped to sell it, who would have
taken a pride far beyond mere commercial
advantage in making it a successful venture.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Take, for example, the question of advertising.
If a publisher issues a volume written by
an author whose later work is likely to be given
to another house, he realizes that whatever
investment he makes must be charged off
against this particular book. On the other
hand, if he feels that the author's relations are
such as to make it probable that the present
publisher will have an opportunity to share in
his later success, then it is good business for
him to invest a larger sum in advertising the
<i>author</i> than he could possibly afford to expend
upon any single <i>book</i>. Here again is the
mutual interest. The author's reputation rests
in a large measure in the hands of his publisher,
and he shares equally in any advantage which
accrues to the publisher from the publicity
which comes to both.</p>

<p>From still another standpoint, the author
can secure material assistance from intimate
relations with his publisher. Many a novel
owes its success to the advice given by the
editorial staff of the publishing-house. Many
a strong story would never have reached its
audience because of mechanical or structural
defects, which the publisher helped to overcome.
There have been instances of unwise
editorial advice, and of undue pressure brought
to bear upon the author to the detriment of
his literary production, but these cases are
rare compared with those of helpful assistance,
which every successful writer will gratefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
acknowledge he has received from his publisher.
In general, the publisher is a wise person in his
own field, and as the ultimate success of a book
depends upon its sale, his advice is usually
based upon a knowledge and an experience
which the author cannot possess. To make
his business a success, the publisher, as well
as the author, must interject his own personality,
this expression taking the form of personal
suggestions, of determining the physical
aspect of the volume, of selecting the artist,
of arranging methods of publicity, and of making
plans for interesting the retail booksellers.</p>

<p>Few publishers depend upon the judgment
of their "readers" to the extent of accepting
or declining manuscripts wholly upon their
opinions. It is inevitable that a large proportion
of the manuscripts submitted should be
culled out and discarded by the professional
reader without ever reaching the final court of
appeal. These readers consider each story
from two distinct standpoints: (1) Has the
author a real story to tell? and (2) How well
has the story been told? If the manuscript
fails to stand the test of the first question, its
doom is sealed at that point; if it passes
through this test, even though it fails in the
second, it will be referred to the publisher for
a final reading, with the critic's comments
affixed to it.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how many manuscripts in
this state are actually read by the publisher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
himself, in view of the countless other details
which naturally devolve upon him; but here
is where he recognizes the first claim upon his
personality. His viewpoint differs from that
of his reader only in that it has narrowed down
to three main questions which he demands of
each manuscript: (1) Does it conform to the
standards of the house? (2) To what and how
large an audience will it appeal? (3) Will the
probable returns warrant the initial investment?</p>

<p>Having settled these points in his mind, the
publisher will further consider the literary
value of the story. If the plot is strong and
original but clumsily constructed, he will discuss
the situation frankly with the author,
and will advise him to rewrite such portions
as demand revision. Many a successful author
has learned how to tell his story through his
publisher's assistance, and owes his present
reputation to the fact that some publisher
discovered in his early, amateurish efforts
the germs of strength and originality, almost
smothered by structural faults.</p>

<p>After the manuscript is ready for the printer,
it is the publisher's function to decide upon its
physical aspect, combining business judgment
and personal taste in producing a volume in
keeping with its content, and in such a dress
as to attract to it that class of bookbuyers who
are influenced by its attractiveness. Nowhere,
perhaps, is the fickleness of the public shown
more than in the taste displayed by this class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
of buyers, and styles obtain in this as much as
in millinery or in dress.</p>

<p>With the plan of the building of the book
determined, the publisher undertakes to create
a demand, first from the booksellers and later
from the public. The traveling salesman is
the usual means to accomplish the first end.
He makes his regular trips at stated seasons,
covering the entire country, carrying with him
"traveler's dummies," which usually consist
of a stamped cover of each book, inside of which
are fastened representative pages and proofs
of illustrations. From these samples, the salesmen
take their "advance orders," and the
publisher usually awaits the tabulation of
these before deciding upon the size of his first
edition.</p>

<p>Other methods are employed in addition to
these, varying with the ingenuity of each publisher:
such as the sending out to the booksellers
of advance copies or sheets, writing special
letters, giving synopses of the stories, etc., all
of which advance preparation requires time
and thought. Authors sometimes become impatient
over what seems to them to be unwarranted
delays, when in reality the publisher is
serving their interests as well as his own by
creating a market before actually placing the
book on sale.</p>

<p>To create a demand on the part of the public
is as difficult in marketing books as any other
commodity. Advertising helps, of course, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
as to the amount, nature, and method of advertising,
each publisher has his own ideas. Each
author naturally regards his own work as
deserving of the maximum publicity, but the
publisher is obliged to consider his list as a
whole. If he thinks it wise to invest a large
sum in advertising a particular story, it is
because he believes that story to possess an
appeal to the public sufficient to warrant this
investment. His judgment may be wrong,
and often is. The book he depends upon does
not respond as he expects, and some other book,
in which he did not have as much confidence,
for some unknown reason suddenly shows
unexpected strength. But the publisher has
been honest in his attempt, even though
faulty in his judgment, and the author who
recognizes this in his attitude to his publisher
will go far toward cementing the bonds of
co-operation which inevitably bring success
to those writers who actually possess, the
genius to demand it.</p>

<p>The fact that one author's contract differs
from another's cannot be taken as evidence
that the publisher has not fulfilled his entire
responsibility to both. An author without an
established reputation has no right to expect
as attractive a contract as one whose name is
of known value to the publisher's list.</p>

<h3>SUBMITTING THE MANUSCRIPT
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
</h3>

<p>The enormous number of manuscripts with
which the publisher is deluged makes it absolutely
necessary, for self-interest, to submit
typewritten copy. Some houses make it a rule
to return handwritten manuscripts unread.</p>

<p>The manuscript should not be bound together
in any way, but the pages should be carefully
numbered consecutively.</p>

<p>The best size of paper is the standard 8½ by
11, and the sheets should be uniform in size.</p>

<p>The paper should not be shiny or slippery,
as this affects the eyes of the reader unpleasantly.</p>

<p>Each page should contain approximately the
same number of lines, as this assists the publisher
in estimating the number of words, and
in determining the probable size of the printed
volume.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Always retain a duplicate copy of a manuscript,
to prevent loss by fire, theft or other
accident. It is an undue responsibility for
an author to place upon a publisher to submit
to him the only copy of a manuscript in existence.
If the manuscript be accepted, it is
also an advantage to have a copy for the use
of the artist, etc.</p>

<p>Write on one side of the paper only.</p>

<p>Deliver the manuscript to the publisher flat
rather than rolled or folded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Manuscript copy costs two cents an ounce
for mailing; when mailed with proof it costs
one-half cent an ounce.</p>

<p>In fastening one piece of paper to another,
or in fastening addenda upon pages already
written, use mucilage rather than pins or clips.</p>

<p>Be sure that the author's name and address
are plainly marked upon the manuscript. The
usual location for this is the upper left-hand
corner of the first page.</p>

<h3>PUBLISHING AT THE AUTHOR'S EXPENSE</h3>

<p>It may be taken as a general statement that
if a book possesses sufficient merit to warrant
its publication at all, a publisher can be found
who is willing to assume the entire risk of the
expense of publication. This statement does
not apply to scientific, technical, or special
works which publishers are glad to have upon
their lists, but which must be subsidized from
some source in order to make publication
financially possible. In the case of a novel,
the statement has no exceptions. No first-class
publishing-house will issue with its imprint,
at the author's expense, a novel in which
it cannot have sufficient confidence to warrant
it in assuming the entire expense.</p>

<p>Frequently the unknown author, eager to
secure the publication of his work, is willing
to make any sacrifice, or any terms, with almost
any house which is willing to assist him
in accomplishing the desired result. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
there are publishing firms who confine their
operations to the publication of manuscripts
to be paid for entirely by the writer. The
general proposition is that the author assumes
the cost of publication, the publisher places
against this his expense of doing business, and
the value&mdash;such as it is&mdash;of his imprint;
and then author and publisher divide the
profits.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is the rarest thing that
there are any profits to divide; and the part
of the whole transaction which is deplorable
is that the publisher must know in advance
that he has, to a certain extent, played upon
the vanity of the author,&mdash;not so much,
perhaps, in what he has actually said to him,
as in the fact that he has shown an enthusiasm
which leads the author to think that he has
really produced a "best seller." There is a
legitimate fee for privately-printed books if
the author goes into the transaction with his
eyes open, and accepts the services of the
publisher as an agent, allowing the publisher's
profit to stand as a return for services rendered.</p>

<p>Authors should be particularly wary of heeding
solicitations from publishing-houses for
manuscripts to be published in this way.</p>

<h3>MAKING THE CONTRACT</h3>

<p>There have been several new elements, in
recent years, entering into the contract between
author and publisher, which have made it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
more complicated business-partnership than in
the past. It was not so long ago, for instance,
that neither author nor publisher would spend
much time discussing the clause relating to
dramatization; for few novels were then
dramatized, and the chance of having this
clause become of importance was remote. To-day,
however, nearly every author considers his
work teeming with potential dramatic probabilities,
and the fact that so many plays have
been produced, based upon successful novels,
naturally leads the publisher to wish, if possible,
a share in this supplementary reward. In
considering this clause, therefore, the author
must take into account the part which his
publisher is likely to play in advancing the
interests of both along these lines.</p>

<p>The present stock contract of most publishing
houses assigns the dramatic rights to the
publisher, but provides that the author shall
share in such profits as may accrue from the
dramatization.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Just where the division shall
occur is a subject for discussion. It seems a
fair contention on the publisher's part that
any interest in dramatization comes from the
popularity which a novel attains, and that
this attainment results from his energy and
ability in placing the book before the public
as much as from the merit of the story itself.
If the author feels this position to be warranted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
he will undoubtedly accept an equal
division; if not, he will insist that the clause
be stricken out.</p>

<p>The moving-picture rights<a name="FNanchor_4a_4a" id="FNanchor_4a_4a"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> add a still more
recent factor to the consideration of the contract.
The development of the moving-picture
business has been so rapid that the demand
found both publishers and authors unprepared
for the unexpected, but no less welcome market
for what must be considered a by-product.
And the possibilities of its further extension are
so unlimited that the returns from this single
source alone may easily prove of greater value
than the original right to publish the novel.
Here, then, is a point which could never have
appeared in the old-time contract, yet which
now warrants the most careful consideration.</p>

<p>The serial rights<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> have long formed a definite
clause to be included or omitted. Often the
publisher's contract is not made until after
the serial publication of the story has been
arranged, in which case it is naturally an entirely
independent business transaction. Frequently,
however, the publisher places the story
serially for the author, arranging his own date
of publication to conform. Obviously, under
these conditions, the publisher is entitled to
share in the returns from the serialization.</p>

<p>The "second serial rights" represent still
another phase. It is the custom for publishers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>to sell these rights to newspapers, and to receive
their pay not in cash but in advertising
space, since by so doing they receive more
than they could get for a fair equivalent in
cash. This second serialization does not ordinarily
take place until a story has had its sale,
and its appearance in this cheaper form is
not supposed to affect the author's royalties
one way or the other. The advertising space
thus secured is used not to advertise the story
so serialized, but other, later books issued by
the same house. The publisher usually credits
the author's royalty account with an arbitrary
sum, equivalent in his estimation to the value
of the transaction. Few contracts contain
any clause covering this point. The publisher
argues that the author, in all probability,
could not have disposed of these rights at any
price, and that whatever amount he receives
is clear gain.</p>

<p>The contracts of various publishing-houses
differ in their clauses covering "author's
alterations," which include all changes made
from the original manuscript as delivered to
the printer. Some publishers allow a flat
sum of $25<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; others allow 10% of the printer's
bill for composition and electrotyping. The
average author cannot understand the expense
of making changes after the manuscript has
been put in type, and this point is one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>most disagreeable features which creep into
the relations between author and publisher.
It is inevitable that certain changes should be
required when the author sees his work reduced
to the rigidity of type, but the publisher should
certainly not be expected to pay the penalty
for elaborate changes which are the results of
the author's carelessness or change of heart.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The rate of royalty depends upon the value
of the author's name to the publisher's list,
but the normal rate is 10% of the retail price.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Some publishers demand that the first thousand
copies shall be exempt from royalty, but this
is looked upon to a certain extent as taking
advantage of the author's lack of reputation.
The best houses, if they are willing to publish
a book at all, are willing to take the whole risk,
allowing the author returns on every copy sold.</p>

<p>On fiction, the rate goes up from 10% to
33⅓%, but at this latter rate the publisher is
giving the author more than he can afford,
hoping to make up for his plunge by the impetus
which this fortunate author's name will give
to the balance of the list. Broadly speaking,
20% is the maximum a publisher can afford to
pay, and then only on a book which is practically
certain to win a place among the best
sellers. A method which seems fair to all
concerned is what is called the "progressive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>royalty." This gives the author say 10% on
the first ten thousand copies, 15% upon the
next ten thousand, and 20% upon all copies
sold over twenty thousand. An arrangement
such as this gives the publisher an opportunity
to charge off all his initial expenses of manufacture,
and to be liberal in his advertising
appropriations in extending and continuing the
sale of the book.</p>

<p>The royalty upon common-and high-school
textbooks is normally 7½% to 10%, but as
the publisher frequently makes special prices
to secure large adoptions, the rate may be less.
Special clauses are usually inserted into contracts
made with authors of books of this
nature, to cover these contingencies. College
textbooks command 10% to 15%.</p>

<p>The clause relating to English rights<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> is
unimportant to the average American author,
for American stories do not as a rule sell well
in England. As a leading English publisher
once jocosely told the writer: "The average
American novel deals either with society or
sport, and we in England don't think you know
much about either in America." If, however,
the author believes his book has a chance, in
all probability the publisher will strike out the
clause, and give him a free hand to make his
arrangements direct. The question of Colonial
rights should not be overlooked, as these sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
prove to be of greater value than the
English rights themselves.</p>

<p>The "option" clause,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> giving the publisher
the refusal of subsequent books, is one which
every publisher is glad to have, as it binds him
to nothing and may prove of value if the
earlier story of the author is successful. On
general principles, it is the part of wisdom,
in any contract, to make no agreement which
does not bind both parties. An author should
consider the probable advantage to himself
in having the publisher feel sufficiently certain
of retaining him upon his list to warrant the
expenditure of larger sums, in advertising and
in pushing the book in hand, than would be
safe if the author were free to take his next
manuscript to another publisher.</p>

<p>The present writer is a strong believer in
the advantage to the author of remaining
on a single publisher's list, provided the publisher
has shown himself to be enterprising,
and inclined to advance the author's interests
simultaneously with his own. There are
unquestionably many instances where an author
can secure larger royalties by "shopping
around," but in the long run better results will
come from a consideration of the bonds between
author and publisher in the light of a business
partnership, not to be broken while relations
remain amicable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
At present there is no uniform book contract
used by all publishers. The blank contract
form here given is that used by a reputable
publishing-house. As a matter of fact, no
present contract of any publisher is wholly
satisfactory, and it is interesting to note that
the subject of contract is one which the leading
houses are taking up seriously with a view to
standardization and improvement.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>MOVING-PICTURE RIGHTS</h3>

<p>The tremendous development in the moving-picture
business has created a demand for
dramatic films taken from long stories, or for
a reproduction entire of short stories, which
offers an entirely new and unexpected revenue
to both publisher and author. Moving-pictures
have passed from the experimental
period into an institution. The reproduction
entire of certain famous stories has given to
the enterprise a dignity which no one could
have predicted, and the outlet they offer for
a by-product is considered perfectly legitimate.</p>

<p>All this produces new conditions in the relations
between author and publisher, and many
new questions have arisen which neither one
may have anticipated at the time the contract
was drawn. It is still necessary to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
interpretations of the laws governing dramatic
regulations, and of the rights involved.</p>

<p>It has been the practice of the moving-picture
producer to buy his plots outright, but with the
new knowledge which has come to the writers
of scenarios and plots of the real value of these
when once assured of success, has also come a
realization of the advantages of making royalty
arrangements instead of selling outright.</p>

<p>As far as the future is concerned, authors
should familiarize themselves with the various
intricacies of this particular field before signing
contracts, making sure that the contract clearly
defines the exact basis of what they part with
and what they retain, or the percentage of
ownership which the author holds in any one
of the various rights.</p>

<p>The following excellent summary is supplied
by the "Authors' League" to its members:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While the business of motion photography is by
no means new, it is only within comparatively recent
times that there has been a general demand for scenarios
and plots. Within the last two or three years
authors have found a new and unsuspected source of
revenue in the sale of 'Cinema' rights to their short
stories, and, although the returns were usually small,
they formed a welcome addition to the writer's income.
Prices frequently depended more upon the advertising
value of the author's name than upon the character of
the material, and ranged from $15 to $150; nevertheless,
many persons not engaged in the usual forms of
literary work have reaped a substantial harvest from
that source. Until recently, subjects have been commonly
confined to one reel of 1000 feet in length, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>owing to the rapid development of the motion-picture
business there has arisen a demand for more pretentious
photoplays, for 'feature films' of multiple reel
length, and, in consequence, many famous books and
dramas have been, and are being, photographed.</p>

<p>The demand is logical and promises to be permanent,
hence the producer finds himself in need of good
subjects, and the author is beginning to recognize his
photoplay rights as something more than an insignificant
by-product of his labor.</p>

<p>It has been the picture-producer's practice to pay
cash for his plots, but royalty arrangements covering
'feature films' are now being made. The latter method
has its drawbacks, for, owing to the existence of a
middle-man, it is more difficult for the photo-playwright
to share in the full returns of his work than it is for the
author of a book or play. The book-publisher or
theatrical-producer distributes his goods directly to
the public, and the author receives a royalty on the
retail price of the book in the one instance, and on the
box-office receipts in the other. The motion-picture
manufacturer, on the contrary, does not sell his films
to the theater or to the public, except in certain cases
noted later, but to an 'exchange' or series of exchanges,
which in turn leases to the exhibitor. Under this
practice, therefore, the author receives a percentage
only upon the rental or purchase price paid by the
exchange to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>The exceptions above referred to, under which the
author may more nearly share in the full returns from
his photoplay, is when state rights, foreign rights, etc.,
to 'feature films' are sold or leased for cash, without
passing through the hands of the exchanges, or when
the producer elects to exhibit his films in his own or
leased theaters. It may be seen, therefore, that while
a sale on a royalty basis is in some ways unsatisfactory
from the author's standpoint, it is on the whole
preferable to a cash sale.</p>

<p>The exchanges are, in effect, circulating libraries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>which distribute reels of film instead of books. The
results are similar to those arising from the English
library system, under which large book sales are almost
impossible, and under which neither author nor publisher
profits greatly from a book's popularity. There
is this difference, however: the publishers of Great
Britain do not own the libraries, while in this country
the exchanges&mdash;at least to a great extent&mdash;are
owned by the manufacturers.</p>

<p>Since many writers are totally unfamiliar with the
conditions of the trade, a word of explanation may be
of value and avoid bewilderment. Broadly speaking,
the motion-picture field is occupied by two factions&mdash;the
'licensed' manufacturers, with their own exchanges
and exhibitors, and the 'independents.' The former
are composed of ten producing firms, the patents and
rights under which they operate being vested in a holding
company&mdash;The General Film Company&mdash;which
is the sales-agent for all regularly released films of the
coalition, and has about fifty branches. These manufacturers
make only 'licensed' films, and distribute
their regular releases only through the general film
company, which in turn leases exclusively to licensed
theaters, of which there are about 10,000 in this country.</p>

<p>The remaining producers, exchanges and exhibitors
comprise the independents.</p>

<p>When an ordinary film of 1000 feet is made, it is
released for exhibition on a given date, and is then
termed a 'first-run picture.' As it gradually wears
out, this rental grows less, and in about six months it
is called in and destroyed. If the subject is popular,
reprints are made, and distributed as before. 'Feature
films' comprising several reels are sometimes handled
as previously noted. Foreign rights are most frequently
sold outright."</p>

<b>Don'ts for Authors</b></p>

<p>"Don't give away your photoplay rights in selling
a story for magazine or book publication.</p>

<p>Don't include them in a dramatic contract without
some clause similar to that governing stock rights.</p>

<p>Don't sell them to the first bidder.</p>

<p>Don't sell them for cash if you can secure a continuing
interest in the film. It may be of value ten
years hence.</p>

<p>Don't decide that your story will not make a
motion-picture. It may contain values which you do
not see.</p>

<p>Don't decide that your story will make a good
photoplay until you understand something about the
requirements and limitations of the business. Remember,
every film must be passed by the National Board
of Censors.</p>

<p>Don't forget that your story must be told in pantomime.</p>

<p>Don't turn your photoplay rights over to the
stranger who offers to adapt and handle your stories
for one-half the proceeds.</p>

<p>Don't forget that you probably sold 'all rights'
to your story when you signed that receipt.</p>

<p>Don't sell the producer a right which you don't
own, and make him buy it over again from the present
owner. He won't like it."</p></blockquote>

<h3>REPORTS ON ROYALTIES</h3>

<p>The methods employed by the various publishing-houses
in keeping and rendering their
accounts with authors vary with each house,
but all publishers are alike to the extent of
realizing that this end of the business must be
absolutely above suspicion. An unwarranted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
rumor, or a clerical error, would raise a question
which might affect the standing of the
house more than any other one thing. For
this reason, the royalty records of all reputable
publishing firms are so kept that they may be
easily inspected if any question arises, and no
objection would ever be made to a request from
an author to make an examination should he
feel that circumstances justified it.</p>

<p>The publisher recognizes that each author is,
in a sense, his partner in the production of a
book, and as such is entitled to intimate information
regarding the progress of their joint
enterprise. Semi-annual statements are rendered,
which are often verified by certified
reports from the publisher's printers and
binders, covering the number of copies manufactured
and sold during each period. Some
publishers include a report of the number of
copies distributed for review or other advertising
purposes; some do not. Some have these
reports checked by public accountants, who
compare the statements of sales with the bills
for printing and binding and the inventories
for paper. But all these varying methods are
based upon accurate, detailed records, which
are carried forward regularly to the author's
account.</p>

<p>Payments upon these semi-annual statements
are usually made four months after they
are rendered, making an average date of seven
months which the publisher takes upon his
royalty account. On the face of it, this seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
too long a time, but those authors who are
familiar with the customs of the trade realize
that the publisher is obliged to sell to the
jobbers and retailers on time, so that in this,
as in other portions of the undertaking, they
are simply sharing the financial necessities.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a id="THE_COPYRIGHT"></a>THE COPYRIGHT</h2>

<p class="dropcap">THE matter of copyright is one which admittedly
requires thorough revision. No one
seems able to explain why it is that in spite of
conferences and delegations, congresses and
discussions, the product of a man's brain is
still at the mercy of regulations which even
those in authority are unable to define. As a
matter of fact, the copyright itself is merely
a registration, which protects only in case the
claimant of the copyright possesses the rights
he claims. The Copyright Office does not
undertake to pass upon his rights, leaving the
question to the courts in case of dispute. It
simply records his claims, and by this recording
gives him certain rights provided his claims
can be substantiated. The statements here
made, therefore, cannot be taken as definitive,
but are based upon information given out
by the Copyright Office, and upon the usage
of the best publishing-houses.</p>

<p>When a publisher has accepted a manuscript,
it becomes a part of his duty to secure the copyright.
Usually, this is taken out in the name
of the publisher rather than of the author, as
the contract itself is really a license to sell
from the author to the publisher. It is also
the duty of the publisher to take all necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
steps to effect renewals of copyright as provided
for by law.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>For those who find it necessary to take out
their own copyrights, the following information
is of value:</p>

<p>The copyright law provides that the application
for registration of any work "shall specify
to which of the following classes the work in
which copyright is claimed belongs":</p>
<ul>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Books, including composite and cyclopaedic
works, directories, gazetteers, and other
compilations.</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) Periodicals, newspapers.</li>

<li>(<i>c</i>) Lectures, sermons, addresses, prepared
for oral delivery.</li>

<li>(<i>d</i>) Dramatic or dramatico-musical compositions.</li>

<li>(<i>e</i>) Musical compositions.</li>

<li>(<i>f</i>) Maps.</li>

<li>(<i>g</i>) Works of art; models or designs for
works of art.</li>

<li>(<i>h</i>) Reproductions of a work of art.</li>

<li>(<i>i</i>) Drawings or plastic works of a scientific
or technical character.</li>

<li>(<i>j</i>) Photographs.</li>

<li>(<i>k</i>) Prints and pictorial illustrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Amendatory act, approved August 24,
1912, added the following two new classes of
works as subject to copyright:</p>
<ul>
<li>(<i>l</i>) Motion-picture photoplays.</li>

<li>(<i>m</i>) Motion pictures other than photoplays.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
A work is not entitled to registration unless
it is reasonably possible to classify it under
one or the other of the above designations
named in the statute.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>¶Compilations, abridgments, adaptations, dramatizations,
translations or other versions of works produced
with the consent of the proprietor of such works,
or works republished with new matter, are regarded
as new works subject to copyright.</p></blockquote>

<p>An alien author or proprietor can be protected
by our law only in case he be domiciled
within the United States at the time of the
first publication of his work; or when the
foreign state or nation of which he is a citizen
or subject grants to citizens of the United
States the benefit of copyright on substantially
the same basis as to its own citizens; or when
such foreign state or nation is a party to an
international agreement which provides for
reciprocity in the granting of copyright by
the terms of which the United States may
become a party thereto.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>¶Copyright protection is at present granted in the
United States to works of authors who are citizens or
subjects of the following countries: Belgium, France,
Great Britain and her possessions, Switzerland, Germany,
Italy, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Mexico, Chile,
Costa Rica, Netherlands and her possessions, Cuba,
China, Norway, Japan (and Korea), Austria, Guatemala,
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Luxemburg,
Sweden, Tunis and Hungary.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>
<h3>

HOW TO SECURE COPYRIGHT REGISTRATION
IN THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<h4>For works reproduced in copies for sale:</h4>

<p>1. Publish the work with the copyright
notice. The notice may be in the form
"Copyright, 19... (year date of publication)
by ... (name of copyright proprietor)."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The date in the copyright notice
should agree with the year date of publication.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
2. Promptly after publication, send to the
Copyright Office two copies of the best edition
of the work, with an application for registration
and a money-order payable to the Register
of Copyrights for the statutory registration
fee of $1.00. (As to special fee for registration
of photographs, see below.) The law
provides "that of the printed book or periodical
the text shall be printed from type set
within the limits of the United States, either
by hand or by the aid of any kind of typesetting
machine, or from plates made within
the limits of the United States from type set
therein, or, if the text be produced by lithographic
process, or photo-engraving process,
then by a process wholly performed within
the limits of the United States."</p>

<p>The law requires also that the postmaster
to whom are delivered the articles to be deposited
in the Copyright Office shall, if requested,
give a receipt therefor, and shall mail
them to their destination without cost to the
copyright claimant.</p>

<p>In the case of books, the copies deposited
must be accompanied by an affidavit, under the
official seal of an officer authorized to administer
oaths, stating that the type-setting,
printing, and binding of the book have been
performed within the United States. Affidavit
and application forms are supplied by the
Copyright Office on request. This affidavit
is not required in the case of works in raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
characters for the use of the blind, or in the
case of a book of foreign origin in a language
or languages other than English, or in the case
of a printed play in any language; as such
works are not required to be manufactured
in the United States.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>contributions</i> to periodicals,
send one complete copy of the periodical containing
the contribution with application and
fee. No affidavit is required.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<h4>For works not reproduced in copies for sale:</h4>

<p>Copyright may also be had of certain classes
of works (see <i>a</i>&mdash;<i>e</i> below) of which copies are
not reproduced for sale, by filing in the Copyright
Office an application for registration with
the statutory fee of $1.00, sending therewith:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the case of lectures or other oral
addresses, or of dramatic or musical compositions,
one complete manuscript or typewritten
copy of the work.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In the case of photographs not intended
for general circulation, one photographic print.
(As to special fee, see next page.)</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) In the case of works of art (paintings,
drawings, sculpture), or of drawings or plastic
works of a scientific or technical character, one
photograph or other identifying reproduction
of the work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
(<i>d</i>) In the case of motion-picture photoplays,
a title and description, with one print
taken from each scene or act.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) In the case of motion-pictures other than
photoplays, a title and description, with not
less than two prints taken from different
sections of a complete motion-picture.</p>

<p>In the case of each of the works above noted,
not reproduced in copies for sale, the law
expressly requires that a second deposit of
printed copies for registration and the payment
of a second fee must be made upon
publication.</p>

<h4>Fees:</h4>

<p>The statutory fee for registration of any
work, except a photograph, is $1.00, including
a certificate of registration under seal. In
the case of a photograph, if a certificate is not
demanded, the fee is fifty cents. In the case
of several volumes of the same <i>book</i> deposited
at the same time, only one registration and
one fee is required.</p>

<h3>HOW TO SECURE COPYRIGHT REGISTRATION
OF PERIODICALS</h3>

<p>1. Publish the issue upon which copyright
protection is desired, printing therein the required
copyright notice, before making any
application to the Copyright Office for registration.
(As to the form and position of the
notice, see page <a href="#Page_34">34</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>

2. Promptly after the publication of each
issue, send two copies thereof to the Copyright
Office, Washington, D.C., with an application
for registration (upon Form "B 1") and a remittance
for the statutory fee of $1.00, which
sum includes the cost of a certificate under
seal. Such certificate "shall be admitted in
any court as prima facie evidence of the
facts stated therein."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>¶Publishers who desire to avoid the trouble of filling
out a separate application form, and of making a separate
remittance for each issue, may send in advance a
sum to be placed to their credit, accompanied by a
general application (upon Form "B 2"), requesting registrations
to be made thereafter upon the prompt deposit
in the Copyright Office of the copies of the successive
issues, from time to time, as they are published.
After this has been done, two copies of each issue
should be mailed to the Copyright Office promptly after
publication, with a slip (supplied in blank by the Copyright
Office) giving the exact date of publication of the
issue (i.e. "the earliest date when copies of the first
authorized edition were placed on sale, or sold, or
publicly distributed by the proprietor of the copyright
or under his authority").</p></blockquote>

<p>The statutory fee for the registration of any
one issue of a periodical is one dollar, including
a certificate under seal as already explained.
Non-certificate, fifty-cent, entries are not permissible
under the present law. Each issue
of a copyright periodical requires the payment
of its own registration fee of one
dollar.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>

Contributions to periodicals:</h4>

<p>Section 3 of the new law provides "that the
copyright provided by this Act shall protect
all the copyrightable component parts of the
work copyrighted, and all matter therein in
which copyright is already subsisting, but
without extending the duration or scope of
such copyright. The copyright upon composite
works or periodicals shall give to the proprietor
thereof all the rights in respect thereto
which he would have if each part were individually
copyrighted under this Act." For
regulations regarding <i>contributions</i> to periodicals
see page <a href="#Page_36">36</a>.</p>

<h4>Titles:</h4>

<p>The general title of a newspaper, magazine,
or other periodical cannot be recorded under
the copyright law. The requirement of the
former law, that a printed title be deposited
on or before the day of publication, has been
abrogated, and the deposit of the title in advance
of publication is no longer authorized.
What the law now requires is that there be
deposited two complete copies of each issue,
promptly after publication.</p>

<h4>Remittances:</h4>

<p>All remittances to the Copyright Office
should be made by money-order, payable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the Register of Copyrights. No money (currency
or coin) should be placed in any letter
or other matter sent to the Copyright Office.
Postage stamps should not be sent as fees.
Private checks will not be accepted unless
certified.</p>

<h3>HOW TO SECURE COPYRIGHT REGISTRATION
OF MOTION-PICTURES</h3>

<p>In order to secure registration of claims to
copyright for such works the following steps
should be taken:</p>

<h4>Motion-picture photoplays:</h4>

<p>I. <i>Motion-picture photoplays not reproduced in
copies for sale</i>: Deposit in the Copyright Office,
Washington, D.C., (1) the title of the motion-picture
photoplay; (2) a description of the
work, preferably either printed or typewritten;
(3) a photograph taken from each scene of
every act. These deposits should be accompanied
by an application for recording the
claim to copyright. For this purpose use
Application Form "L 2," which is furnished
by the Copyright Office upon request. Also
send with the application the statutory registration
fee of $1.00.</p>

<p>II. <i>Motion-picture photoplays reproduced in copies
for sale</i>: When the motion-picture photoplay
has been published (i.e., placed on sale,
sold, or publicly distributed) with the required
notice of copyright upon each copy, promptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
after such publication deposit in the Copyright
Office two complete copies of the work,
accompanied by an application for recording
the claim to copyright in the published
work. For this purpose use Application Form
"L 1," which is furnished by the Copyright
Office upon request. Also send with the application
the statutory registration fee of $1.00.</p>

<h4>Motion-pictures other than photoplays:</h4>

<p>I. <i>Motion-pictures other than photoplays not reproduced
in copies for sale</i>: Deposit in the Copyright
Office, Washington, D.C., (1) the title
of the motion-picture; (2) a description of
the work, preferably either printed or typewritten;
(3) two or more photographs taken
from different sections of the complete motion-picture.
These deposits should be accompanied
by an application for recording the
claim to copyright. For this purpose use
Application Form "M 2," which is furnished
by the Copyright Office upon request. Also
send with the application the statutory fee
of $1.00.</p>

<p>II. <i>Motion-pictures other than photoplays reproduced
in copies for sale</i>: When the work has
been published (i.e., placed on sale, sold, or
publicly distributed) with the required notice
of copyright upon each copy, promptly
after such publication deposit in the Copyright
Office two complete copies of the work,
accompanied by an application for recording<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the claim to copyright in the published work.
For this purpose use Application Form "M 1,"
which is furnished by the Copyright Office
upon request. Also send with the application
the statutory fee of $1.00.</p>

<p>In all cases, the money order remitting the
registration fee should be made payable to
the "Register of Copyrights." Send the title,
description, prints, copies, application and fee in
one parcel, addressed to the Register of Copyrights,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>If any motion-picture has been registered
as a work "not reproduced in copies for sale,"
it must nevertheless be registered a second
time if it has been afterward published.</p>

<h3>AD INTERIM PROTECTION</h3>

<p>In the case of a book published abroad in
the English language before publication in
the United States, the deposit in the Copyright
Office at Washington, not later than thirty
days after its publication abroad, of one complete
copy of the foreign edition, with a request
for the reservation of the copyright, and a
statement of the name and nationality of the
author and of the copyright proprietor, and
of the date of the publication of the book,
secures to the author or proprietor an <i>ad
interim</i> copyright, which has all the force and
effect given by copyright, and extends until
the expiration of thirty days after such
deposit in the Copyright Office. Whenever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
within the period of this <i>ad interim</i> publication,
an authorized edition of the book is published
within the United States in accordance
with the manufacturing provisions specified
in the American copyright law, and when the
provisions of the American law as to deposit
of copies, registration, filing of affidavit, and
the printing of the copyright notice have been
duly complied with, the protection is then
extended over the full term.</p>

<h3>ASSIGNMENT OF COPYRIGHT</h3>

<p>A copyright may be assigned, granted, or
mortgaged by an instrument in writing signed
by the proprietor of the copyright. No special
blank form for assignment is issued by the
Copyright Office.</p>

<h4>Recording assignments:</h4>

<p>Every assignment of copyright should be
recorded in the Copyright Office within three
calendar months after its execution in the
United States, or within six calendar months
after its execution without the limits of the
United States, "in default of which it shall
be void as against any subsequent purchaser or
mortgagee for a valuable consideration, without
notice, whose assignment has been duly
recorded."</p>

<p>The original instrument of assignment should
be sent to the Copyright Office to be placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
on record. A valuable document of this kind
should be forwarded by registered post.</p>

<p>After having been recorded, a certificate of
record under seal of the Copyright Office is
attached, and it is then returned by post. If
the sender desires to have it returned by registered
post, ten cents postage for the post-office
registry fee should be sent in addition
to the recording fees as stated below.</p>

<h4>Notice in assignee's name:</h4>

<p>When an assignment of the copyright in a
specified book or other work has been recorded,
the assignee may substitute his name for that
of the assignor in the copyright notice. In
order that this transfer of proprietorship may
properly appear upon the index of the Copyright
Office, a fee of ten cents (prescribed by
law) for each title of a book or other article
transferred is required for indexing, and this
fee should be remitted in addition to the fee
prescribed for recording the instrument as
explained below.</p>

<h4>Foreign assignments:</h4>

<p>Every assignment of copyright executed in
a foreign country must be acknowledged by
the assignor before a consular officer or secretary
of legation of the United States, authorized
by law to administer oaths or perform notarial
acts. The certificate of such acknowledgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
under the hand and official seal of such consular
officer or secretary of legation is prima
facie evidence of the execution of the instrument.</p>

<h3>FEES</h3>

<p>The following schedule of fees, in addition to
those already given, is fixed by the statute:</p>

<p>1. For recording and certifying any instrument
in writing for the assignment of copyright,
or any license to make use of copyright
material, or for any copy of such assignment or
license, duly certified, if not over three hundred
words in length, one dollar; if more than three
hundred and less than one thousand words
in length, two dollars; if more than one
thousand words in length, one dollar additional
for each additional one thousand words
or fraction thereof over three hundred words.</p>

<p>2. For comparing any copy of an assignment
with the record of such document in the
Copyright Office and certifying the same under
seal, one dollar.</p>

<p>3. For recording the transfer of the proprietorship
of copyrighted articles, ten cents for
each title of a book or other article, in addition
to the fee prescribed for recording the
instrument of assignment.</p>

<h3>THE DURATION OF COPYRIGHT</h3>

<p>The duration of the term of copyright is
twenty-eight years. This term may be extended
for a further term of twenty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
years by the author of the work, if living, or
by the widow, widower, or children, or, if
they be not living, then by the author's executors,
or in absence of a will, by his next of kin.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>¶Application for this extension must be made to the
Copyright Office and duly registered there within one
year prior to the expiration of the original term.</p></blockquote>

<h3>THE PROTECTION OF TITLES</h3>

<p>The cases which have thus far been settled
in litigation indicate that there is nothing at
present in the copyright law which gives to
the author the exclusive right to the title of
his particular work. There may be any number
of books or stories brought out by different
authors bearing the same title so long as each
one is distinct and original.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION FORMS</h3>

<p>Applicants for copyright registration should
use the application forms furnished on request

<h3>PRACTICAL PROCEDURE</h3>

<p>The methods of each publisher in the various
steps toward registration of copyright may
vary in details, but the following method may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
be taken as typical and sufficient for the average
American book copyrighted in the United
States:</p>

<p>1. The type must be set up in the United
States, and, if the book is printed from plates,
the plates be made therefrom;</p>

<p>2. The book must be printed and bound in
the United States;</p>

<p>3. The book must bear the copyright notice.</p>

<p>4. On the date set for publication, copies
are for the first time offered to the public,
sold or publicly distributed by the publisher
or his authorized agents. This constitutes the
"act of publication," on which the registration
of copyright depends. The sale of these copies
is recorded on the publisher's books in the
same manner as the sale of any of his books,
and this dating of the sale on his books is often
deemed sufficient record of the first publication.
In case books are to be distributed for sale by
various booksellers as well as by the publisher
himself, the booksellers must be notified in advance
in order that no copies may be sold
previous to the date set for first publication.</p>

</div>

<p>5. Either on the same day as the book is
first published or promptly thereafter (but
not before), blank Application and Affidavit
Form "A 1" is filled out and sworn to.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>copies of the book for deposit with the Copyright
Office, together with this completed
Application Form and a post-office money-order
for the required fee of $1.00 made payable
to the Register of Copyrights, are made
up into one package, and the package addressed
to: <i>The Register of Copyrights, Washington,
D.C.</i> On the outside of the package is
marked: "Books for Copyright Registration."
The package is then delivered to the post-office,
and the postmaster, if requested, will sign a
receipt for the package which the publisher
makes out. This receipt should contain the
name of the book, the date, and the fact that
the copies are to be transmitted to the Register
of Copyrights in Washington for purpose of
registration of copyright. The postmaster is
required by law to forward these copies to the
Copyright Office without expense to the sender.</p>

<p>6. After a few days a receipt under seal will
come from the Copyright Office, certifying
that the books have been received, with the
remittance and application, and that the copyright
has been duly recorded.</p>

<p>This is all that needs to be done for twenty-seven
years, in case the copyright has not in
the meantime been assigned. In case of assignment
this fact should be recorded in the
Copyright Office in accord with the methods
specified.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
After twenty-seven years have passed, and
within one year of the expiration of the copyright,
the owner may renew it for twenty-eight
years more upon application to the Copyright
Office.</p>

<h3>INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT</h3>

<p>In America, with the general lack of definite
knowledge concerning all matters relating to
copyright, the so-called "International Copyright"
is equally shrouded in uncertainty.
As the United States is not yet a member of
the International Copyright Union as established
in the convention of Berne, and cannot
join this Union so long as the present clause in
the American copyright law exists requiring
all books to be completely manufactured within
the United States in order to secure copyright,
it will be evident that registration at Washington
does not secure protection abroad.
Mutual copyright protection has been arranged,
however, by special treaties with foreign
nations. The countries with which these
treaty relations exist at present include: Belgium,
France, Great Britain and her possessions,
Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Denmark,
Portugal, Spain, Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica,
Netherlands and her possessions, Cuba, China,
Norway, Japan (and Korea), Austria, Guatemala,
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Luxemburg,
Sweden, Tunis and Hungary. Inasmuch
as we are not yet members of the International<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Copyright Union it is, strictly speaking, impossible
for a citizen of the United States to
secure "International Copyright" on his book,
though a book can be protected in most of the
countries where protection is desirable.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Many
publishers secure copyright in Great Britain
and her dependencies by publishing in England
simultaneously with the American publication,
and by conforming to the other requirements
of the British law. A few publishers
are of the opinion that protection in Great
Britain and her colonies can be secured by
publishing simultaneously in Canada instead
of in England. Whether or not this is equally
binding cannot be definitely determined, as
no test case has as yet been made to establish
or dispute the fact.</p>

<p>Recent copyright legislation in England has
been pointed in the direction of more strict
regulations regarding bona fide publication in
England of American books on which English
copyright is desired. This is a step in the
right direction, and defines the issue somewhat
more clearly, but even now conditions are not
as well defined as they should be, or as they
must ultimately be. The following statements
may be made:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Simultaneous publication is necessary in
England and the United States. The English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>agents, therefore, should be supplied with not less
than seven copies of the book at least one week
before the date fixed for American publication.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>¶Great care should be taken that the date selected
for publication is not Saturday, Sunday or a public
holiday in England. These public holidays are: Easter
Monday, Monday in Whitsun-week, first Monday in
August, December 26 (or, if Sunday, December 27),
Good Friday and Christmas Day.</p>

<p>In Canada the public holidays are: New Year's,
Good Friday, Easter Monday, Empire Day (May 24),
Dominion Day (July 1), first Mondays in August and
September (Labor Day), Thanksgiving and Christmas
Day.</p></blockquote>

<p>The publication is accepted in England as
being simultaneous if the time between publication
in England and in America does not
exceed fourteen days. It is important to note
that when the case is reversed the "simultaneous"
publication of an American book in
England must be made on the exact day of its
publication in America.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The so-called English agent must be an
English publisher. On the day appointed for
publication, the English agent must make
formal sale of at least one copy of the volume,
and the entry of such sale must appear upon
his books. Six copies are delivered by the
agent to the following libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>British Museum</i></li>
<li><i>Bodleian Library, Oxford</i></li>
<li><i>University Library, Cambridge</i></li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
<i>Library of the Faculty of Advocates, Edinburgh</i></li>
<li><i>Library of Trinity College, Dublin</i></li>
<li><i>National Library of Wales</i></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

<p>¶It is not obligatory that five of these six copies be
delivered unless demand is formally made within twelve
months after publication, but if the books are not in
stock for delivery then the agent may be fined £5 plus
the cost of the volume. The copy for the British
Museum must be delivered within one month after
publication.</p>

<p>If an edition de luxe is issued, the copy sent to the
British Museum must be of this edition.</p></blockquote>

<p>Points which are still to be settled in the
new English copyright law are, whether or
not, in order to make a bona fide publication,
copies should be sent out for review, and
advertised or offered for sale by the traveling
salesmen of the English publisher. It is
probable that these points will be definitely
determined within the next few months. The
English act requires a genuine publication to
satisfy public demand, and not merely a "colourable"
formality. What "public demand"
may be has not yet been defined.</p>

<p>There is no necessity for printing any notice
of English copyright, as the English law does
not require it; but it is customary, on American
books copyrighted in England, to use the
words, "Copyright in England," to give warning
that copyright is claimed on the book.
It is not considered necessary to have the
English publisher's imprint on the title-page
of such books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>

The expression sometimes seen on the copyright
page, "All rights reserved including that
of translation into foreign languages including
the Scandinavian," is now valueless. The
American and English copyrights protect the
book in all countries with which the United
States has copyright relations, and the notice
would not prevent appropriation in any country
with which the United States has no copyright
relations. The expression came into use
during the years preceding our present reciprocal
copyright arrangements, and is now discontinued
by those familiar with its original
significance.</p>

<h2><a id="RELATIONS_OF_THE_SHORT-STORY_WRITER_TO_THE_MAGAZINES"></a>RELATIONS OF THE SHORT-STORY
WRITER TO THE MAGAZINES</h2>

<p class="dropcap">THE contributor to the magazines stands in
a relation entirely different from that of the
novelist to his publisher. In this case, the
author has no joint interest with the publisher,
being but one of many contributors to
the magazine as a whole. In an article in
their "Bulletin," the Authors' League refers
to these dealings as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In his relations with the magazine publisher, the
short-story writer may be considered either as an
independent merchant, peddling his wares, or as an
employee,&mdash;on the same plane with the ink-dealer
and the paper-house, say, or on the same plane with the
sub-editor and the cashier. The magazine publisher,
for selfish reasons, generally prefers to consider him
as a merchant. Your committee, for reasons equally
selfish but perhaps better founded, considers him rather
in the light of an employee. First, and most importantly,
the ink-dealer and the paper-house have capital;
the magazine writer brings nothing to his business but
his brain and his two hands. In the second place, a
great deal of the writing for our periodicals is done by
men and women employed on salary, and economically
in the same category as the cashier or the sub-editor.
The man or woman who writes 'on the outside,' either
on speculation or on order, it seems to us, is no less a
temporary employee of the magazine.</p>

<p>This consideration enters into the first grievance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>which has been urged by many of our members against
certain of our magazines,&mdash;the deferring of payments
after the acceptance of the article or story. As every
one knows, the custom of our leading periodicals varies
greatly in this regard. Some pay upon acceptance,
not nominally but really. Certain others pay within
the month. Still others pay just about when the author
can get it. The staff writer receives his regular salary
every week; the free-lance writer, working on order,
temporarily just as much a part of the magazine staff
as any regular employee, often has to wait for weeks and
months. Certain of the magazine publishers interviewed
by your committee have their ready-made
answer to this: 'The ink maker and the paper manufacturer
give us time: they wait one, two, or three
months for their money; why should we be any more
prompt with the author?' This position, on the theory
that the magazine writer is only an outside employee,
is of course untenable."</p></blockquote>

<h3>COPYRIGHT</h3>

<p>From the same source comes most valuable
comment regarding the importance of a fuller
knowledge on the part of the short-story writer
of the exact bearing of the copyright law upon his
work, being the statements upon recent opinions
handed down as a result of litigation. Briefly,
these opinions are to the effect that a magazine
copyright covers the matter contained in each
number only to the extent to which such matter
is the property of the magazine. It therefore
follows that in the case of a story, of which
only the magazine rights have been sold by
the author, the magazine copyright leaves him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
absolutely unprotected in his dramatic and, theoretically
at least, in his book rights. To save
whatever he reserves, he must take copyright,
also, in his own name, fulfilling the necessary
formalities, such as paying a separate fee, depositing
two copies of the book in the Library
of Congress, and seeing that his notice of copyright
appears upon the story when published
in the magazine.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The attorney for the
Authors' League advises as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"So long as this and similar matters remain in doubt,
both authors and publishers should, for their own
protection, agree on some system whereby the dramatic
and all other rights are thoroughly safeguarded.
This can be accomplished in either of two ways:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The editor can copyright each story or article
separately in the author's name, printing at the bottom
of the first page thereof a proper copyright notice,
as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
'Copyright, 1913, by John Doe'
</p>

<p>The author should then, immediately on publication,
mail one copy of the magazine to the Register of
Copyrights in Washington, in conformity with the
requirements of the present Act, enclosing the fee of
One Dollar. This is perhaps the simplest way, although
it involves a separate registration of the magazine
for each story or article so copyrighted.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Or the author can sell his story outright to
the editor or publisher, and safely reserve his equitable
interests in the dramatic or other rights thereto by
attaching to his manuscript a 'rider' or slip somewhat
as follows:</p>

<p>'This manuscript is submitted with the understanding
that, if accepted for publication, the same
shall be copyrighted by the publishers, and all rights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>under said copyright (except that of magazine publication)
shall be held in trust for the benefit of the
writer or his assigns, and will be reassigned to him upon
demand.'"</p></blockquote>

<h3>PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS</h3>

<p>The general advice under "Submitting the
Manuscript"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> applies with added force to the
manuscripts of short stories, as the number
of such manuscripts submitted to editors is
naturally greater than in the case of novels
and publishers. In a word, make the reading
of your story as attractive and as easy for the
editor as possible. In addition, these points
are of importance in submitting manuscripts
of short stories:</p>

<p>Use double space in typewriting.</p>

<p>Be sure that your typewriting machine is in
good order. Typewritten manuscript possesses
an individuality as well as hand-script, and
inaccurate or slovenly pages prejudice the
reader.</p>

<p>Always enclose a stamped, addressed envelope,
and be sure that the postage is not
underpaid. Manuscript copy costs two cents
an ounce; when mailed with proof, it costs
one-half cent an ounce.</p>

<p>Write your name and address in the upper,
left-hand corner of the first page; in the upper,
right-hand corner write the approximate
number of words.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>

A short story is usually supposed to contain
from 3000 to 6000 words.</p>

<p>Number your pages consecutively.</p>

<p>The manuscript may be folded, not more than
twice, but should never be rolled.</p>

<h3>DEALINGS WITH THE EDITOR</h3>

<p>The letter accompanying the manuscript
should be brief, business-like, and to the point.
The editor is too busy to concern himself
with anything in connection with the writer
or the story except the story itself.</p>

<p>Don't call upon the editor, or send him a
letter of introduction; let the merit of your
story be your only sponsor.</p>

<p>Don't ask the editor to criticize your work;
place the manuscript in the hands of a professional
reader if that is what you desire.</p>

<p>Be patient. It is reasonable to expect a
decision upon your manuscript within three
months' time, but not sooner.</p>

<p>Don't be offended by the receipt of a printed
rejection slip. Personal letters are not to be
expected.</p>

<p>Accept the editor's judgment cheerfully.
Nothing is ever gained, and much is usually
lost, by personal pique.</p>

<p>Study the spirit and policy which lie behind
each publication. Just as a merchant offers
his wares only in the market where the demand
exists, make sure in your own mind that your
story fits the magazine to which you send it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>

Look upon the return of a manuscript as an
opportunity for revision and improvement
before sending it out again. Study it, and try
yourself to discover why it did not succeed.</p>

<p>Keep a careful record of the peregrinations
of your various manuscripts.</p>

<p>Be timely, remembering that "seasonable"
stories should be received by the magazines
four to six months before the season arrives.</p>

<p>The best magazines have a regular rate of
payment, so it is needless to discuss terms in
submitting your manuscript.</p>

<p>Never give a story away. If it is worth
publishing it is worth being paid for, and to
part with it for nothing injures the literary
market for your fellow-writers as well as for
yourself.</p>

<p>There is much difference of opinion regarding
the ethics of submitting the same manuscript
to more than one magazine at a time. In
this matter each writer must settle the question
for himself. There is no general custom, but
good taste would seem to argue against the
practice.</p>

<p>It is seldom wise to submit more than one
story at a time to the same magazine.</p>

<h3>THE LITERARY AGENT</h3>

<p>Enlarging upon what has been said in an
earlier chapter,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the literary agent may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>found much more useful in the marketing of
short stories than in novels. The relations of
the author to the publisher are much closer
than those existing between the short-story
writer and the magazine editor, and the personality
of the author is a less important
factor. If the writer of short-stories makes a
study of the market, and possesses ordinary
business ability, he has no more occasion for
an "agent" than a man engaged in any other
profession. On the other hand, it is a fact
that the average writer does not develop
himself along these lines, so that the advice
and co-operation of one who makes a business
of acting as a go-between can be made exceedingly
valuable.</p>

<p>In placing oneself in the hands of a literary
agent, great care should be exercised to select
one with a reputation for the successful placing
of manuscripts and for prompt financial
dealings.</p>

<p>The ordinary commission of the literary
agent is 10 per cent. upon all sums received on
account of the author, and it is customary for
him to handle the financial as well as the
literary relations between the writer and the
magazines.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a id="THE_MECHANICS_OF_THE_BOOK"></a>THE MECHANICS OF THE BOOK</h2>

<p class="dropcap">SOME authors have a general idea of how a
book is manufactured, but more have none.
Even in the case of experienced writers, every
printing-office could tell surprising stories to
illustrate the unreasonableness born of a lack
of knowledge of the ordinary mechanics of
manufacture, or of a confidence born of too
little knowledge. And unreasonableness on
the part of the author means extra and unnecessary
expense either to the printer or to
the publisher. One of the most unfortunate
features of the publishing business is that the
exact cost of manufacturing a book can rarely
be estimated in advance: typography, electrotyping,
engraving, designing, presswork, paper,
and binding can be figured closely, but the
"extras," resulting from the author's carelessness,
lack of knowledge of the book's mechanics,
or change of heart as the manuscript
goes into type, in many cases so increase the
cost beyond the publisher's expectations that
the publication can only show a loss instead of
a profit.</p>

<p>These "extras" result from different causes:
the manuscript may be carelessly prepared,
with poor punctuation and clumsy expressions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
which the author corrects in the proof. The
author frequently boasts, "I know nothing
about punctuation," but would an artist admit
that he was ignorant of how to mix his colors?
There is no question that authors sometimes
take advantage of their "temperament," and
lie down upon it in a manner most unfair to
their co-partners in the enterprise.</p>

<p>Changes in the manuscript cost nothing,
changes in the type cost one dollar per hour.
To correct vital points after the book is in
type is warranted; to correct blunders in
punctuation or expression is needless expense,
and is a reflection upon the intelligence of the
author. Genius may be erratic, but it is more
respected when it is not made to carry the
responsibility of ordinary carelessness or ignorance.
The writer recalls a case where the
author of a story changed the name of one of
the characters after the book was in type;
it cost the publishers over eighty dollars.
Frequently an author changes the name of
his story, necessitating resetting the running-heads,
the title-page, and recutting the brass
dies, all of which adds expense beyond the
publisher's original estimate. Countless other
examples might be cited, but the main point
is that all vital details should be discussed and
settled while the story is still in manuscript,
and after it has been placed in the printer's
hands further changes should be only those
which are of serious moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>

Other "extra" expenses include the cost of
proofs. The publisher usually receives from the
printer two sets of galley-proof, two sets of
page-proof, and two sets of foundry-proof.
All proofs beyond these six sets are charged
for as "extra," the usual rate being one cent
per page.</p>

<p>If the author retains his proof longer than is
necessary to read and correct it, this delay
frequently forces the printer to work over-time
to meet publication-day; this over-time work
is charged for at double price.</p>

<p>An author would never have any difficulty
in securing a letter of introduction from his
publisher to some large printing-house, and the
printer would gladly give him every opportunity
to familiarize himself with the mechanical
processes. This knowledge, together with
a study of those elements which go into the
manufacture of a book, would enable the
author to avoid needless cost, or to incur
intelligently such extra expense as became
vitally necessary.</p>

<p>The following suggestions are important
regarding the relations between the author and
the printer:</p>

<p>It is always wiser to leave all questions of
typography for the publisher to settle with the
printer, unless there is some specific reason
why the author wishes to accomplish a particular
result by using certain type effects.</p>

<p>Copy should be typewritten, and revised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
carefully by the author, before sending it to
the printer, to correct typewriter's errors.
Interlineations and erasures which make the
reading difficult should be avoided. It is
always a simple matter to rewrite such portions
without rewriting the entire chapter.</p>

<p>If the author has decided preferences regarding
spelling or punctuation, this fact should
be clearly stated on the manuscript; otherwise
the printer follows his office style, which
may or may not conform with the author's
ideas.</p>

<p>In the preparation of copy, consistency of
spelling and punctuation is strongly urged,
as it not only simplifies the problem for the
printer, but also prevents possible misunderstanding
of copy and consequent necessity for
resetting.</p>

<p>All paragraphs should be clearly indicated
in the copy.</p>

<p>All directions written upon the manuscript,
which are not intended as "copy," should be
enclosed in a circle.</p>

<p>The author should punctuate each sentence
as he writes it, for in this way the marks are
indicative of the natural pauses, and better
express his meaning.</p>

<p>Foot-notes should always be clearly indicated.</p>

<p>Unusual words, proper names, and figures
should be written out with the greatest care
and distinctness by the author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>

It is for the common advantage of the author,
the publisher, and the printer that the author
or the editor read all proofs promptly.</p>

<h3>ESTIMATING THE MANUSCRIPT</h3>

<p>The usual procedure in making a book is
as follows: When the publisher sends the
manuscript to the printer, a request goes with
it for a sample page, set to a size and in a type
which will make a volume of the desired number
of pages. A novel is supposed to run from
320 pages to 400 pages. The first thing to be
done is to estimate the number of words in
the manuscript, and this is accomplished by
averaging the number of words in say thirty
lines, and then multiplying by the number of
lines on a page. No allowance is made for
fractional lines, as these also occur in the
printed page. If the manuscript is carefully
written, each page will contain the same number
of lines, so the total number of words may
be found by multiplying the number of words
on the page, as arrived at above, by the total
number of pages in the manuscript. This
explains the importance of having a standard
number of lines on each page.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> No allowance
is made for fractional pages at the end of chapters,
as there are also fractional pages in the
printed book, and it averages up.</p>

<p>The front matter has to be estimated separately,
with allowance for the blanks on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
reverse of bastard-title, dedication, etc.,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but
the usual number of pages is eight. Then,
again, an allowance of half a page for each
chapter sinkage<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> has to be made. Suppose
we have a manuscript of 90,000 words, with 24
chapters: A type page of 280 words gives us
322 pages, to which we add 8 pages for front
and 12 pages for chapter sinkages, giving us a
volume of about 344 pages. As the presswork
is usually done in forms of 32 pages, an effort is
always made not to exceed even forms by a small
number of pages. Striking out the bastard-title
will often save a form of press-work.</p>

<p>Various short-cuts have been suggested for
estimating the number of words in a printed
page, but the old-fashioned method of counting
is the safest. Here is a table which is as
accurate as any short-cut can be:</p>

<table summary="number of words">

<h3>THE SAMPLE PAGE</h3>

<p>With these details settled, the sample page
is next in order. Knowing that the book is
to be a 12mo (size of leaf 5⅛ × 7⅝) or a
10mo (size of leaf 5½ × 8¼), the printer must
"lay out" the page so as to leave margins of
proper size and proportion. A 12mo type
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
page may vary from 3 × 5¼ inches to 4 × 6¾
inches. Somewhere within this area, in the
given example, the page must contain about
280 words. If the manuscript is long, then
the type page must be large, the type itself
small (never smaller than long primer<a name="FNanchor_36a_36a" id="FNanchor_36a_36a"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> nor
larger than pica<a name="FNanchor_36b_36b" id="FNanchor_36b_36b"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>), the leads<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> reduced or omitted
altogether. This is where the printer's taste
and skill is given an opportunity for expression:
he is the architect of the book, and must not
combine types or decorations which are inharmonious,
and his proportions must be kept
correct.</p>

<p>For his sample page for the given novel, the
printer would select from these standard faces:</p>

<p>Type sizes in the present day are determined
by the point system, the fundamental unit of
which is the point. This is obtained by
dividing a length of 13⅘ inches into 996 equal
parts, each one being called a point. One
point is therefore .0138 of an inch or 72.46
points are equal to 1 inch.</p>

<p>For purposes of convenience, a point is
expressed as being <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">72</span></span> of an inch. Thus
6-point type occupies <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">6</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">72</span></span>
of an inch of space,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
12-point <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">12</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">72</span></span>
and so on. This does not
mean, however, that the actual printed face
occupies six points on the paper, but that it
is six points from the base to the top of the
body carrying the face.</p>

<p>In other words, one may say that it is 12
points from the bottom of one line of 12-point
type to the <i>bottom</i> of the next line of 12-point
type, etc.</p>

<p>The pica is the standard of measurement of
the old system, and is equal to 12 points of the
new system; thus six picas are equal to 1 inch
or 72 points. Printers still estimate the length
and width of a page or a column by the pica;
thus a page 4 inches wide is 24 picas.</p>

<p>The "em" is the square of a type body.
Thus a "12-point em" is 12 points wide and
12 points long, or 1 pica long and 1 pica wide.
A "10-point em" is a 10 point square, etc.
The em used in measuring newspaper column
widths, magazine columns, etc., is known as
the em pica, which is 12 points square.</p>

<p>In using larger faces for headings and display,
or smaller faces for footnotes or quoted
matter, the printer will select from the same
family to which the type belongs, or from some
family which combines with it harmoniously.
Old-style faces should not be used with
modern faces, but the Scotch face, which is a
cross between old-style and modern, combines
well with either.</p>

<p>As to leading, this volume is leaded with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
1-point lead; between the first and second lines
of the preceding paragraph there is no leading
(technically, "set solid"); between the second
and third, a 2-point lead, and between the
third and fourth, a 3-point lead.</p>

<p>In technical volumes and schoolbooks the
Old Style Antique type is largely used for
subject-headings and side-notes:</p>

</div>

<h3>THE TYPESETTING</h3>

<p>With the sample page accepted by the publisher
or author, or both, the printer is authorized
to proceed with the typesetting. Setting
type by hand is now almost entirely superseded
by machine-composition, except for the display
pages (such as the title) and where the type
itself runs larger than the English (14-point)
size, this being the limit of the machines.
Linotype<a name="FNanchor_37b_37b" id="FNanchor_37b_37b"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> composition is cheaper than monotype,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
but as the type is cast all in one line,
instead of in separate characters, the cost of
corrections is much higher. To change even
a mark of punctuation requires recasting the
entire line. If the manuscript is reasonably
final in its form, the publisher is likely to order
linotype composition; otherwise, monotype
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>will be selected. Both machines carry the
standard faces and sizes of type.</p>

<h3>THE PROOFS</h3>

<p>The first proofs sent out by the printer are
called "galley-slips," or "galleys."<a name="FNanchor_38b_38b" id="FNanchor_38b_38b"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> These
are supposed to give the author opportunity
to make such changes as are absolutely necessary.
When returned to the printer, these
galleys are made up into "page-proofs,"<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and
frequently go again to the author, or the type
may be "cast" (made into electrotype plates)
at this point. When page-proofs are submitted
to the author, the publisher expects
him to revise them, making sure that all his
galley corrections have been properly made,
rather than to make further corrections, as
changes in the pages are still more expensive
than in the galleys. If changes must be
made, the author should endeavor to have the
correction occupy exactly the same space as
the matter cut out, or to cut out further matter
to make room for the addition. Otherwise,
the page so corrected will contain more than
the standard number of lines, which must be
thrown forward, and the make-up of each page
changed to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>Competent proofreaders in the best offices
frequently call the attention of the author to
errors in dates, figures, or proper names, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
this should always be regarded by the author
as a courtesy rather than as something which
the printer is expected to do. The proofreader,
on the other hand, is supposed to have
corrected every typographical error, and for
the author to mark corrections which have
been overlooked is a courtesy on the part of
the author. The fact that the author or editor
has passed over typographical errors in
no way relieves the proofreader of his responsibility.</p>

<p>The proofreader is expected to correct any
obvious error without hesitation, but to make
no other changes. If he thinks a change
should be made, it will take the form of a query
in the margin to the author. The author
should carefully note all such queries, and
answer them or strike them out, bearing in
mind that if he accepts the query the change
necessitated in the type becomes an author's
correction, the expense of which falls upon the
publisher.</p>

<p>Any marks on the proofs for correction
should be made distinct by drawing a short
line through the letter to be changed, etc.,
placing in the margin the recognized sign indicating
the change, <i>exactly opposite the line in
which the change is to be made, and in the order
in which the necessary alterations occur</i>. In
doing this be sure to write legibly, and do not
cover the proof with lines and counter-lines.</p>

<p>The author should familiarize himself with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the standard proofreading marks, and employ
these in marking all corrections upon the
proofs which are sent him. These marks are
as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_079b.jpg" width="400" height="490" alt="PROOF MARKS" />

<div class="box">
<blockquote>
<p class="dropcap"><small>THE above marks are the ones most generally used in proofreading.
There are many others that are required in different classes of work,
but these are in the main self-explanatory. This display of proof marks
and their meanings has been prepared for <span class="smcap">The Graphic Arts</span> and endorsed
by the Boston Proofreaders Association.</small></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>

When the page-proofs are returned to the
printer, they are carefully "read for foundry"
by the proofreader, and all final changes in
the type are then made. "Bearers"<a name="FNanchor_39a_39a" id="FNanchor_39a_39a"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> are
placed around pages, which are imposed<a name="FNanchor_39b_39b" id="FNanchor_39b_39b"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
in chases<a name="FNanchor_39c_39c" id="FNanchor_39c_39c"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and sent to foundry.<a name="FNanchor_39d_39d" id="FNanchor_39d_39d"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Foundry-proofs
are taken at this point.</p>

<h3>THE PLATES</h3>

<p>The process of electrotyping is one of the
most interesting steps in the making of a book,
and authors will find it well worth while to
brave the grime of the black-lead in order to
become familiar with the detail. In brief,
the type form is pressed down into a tablet
made of wax or similar substance, in which
it leaves an impression. This wax tablet is
then allowed to remain in a galvanic bath,
through which it becomes covered with a
coating of copper. When separated from the
wax, the thin, copper replica of the composed
type is backed up by an alloy, and, after passing
through various stages in finishing, finally
becomes an electrotype plate.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<h3>COVER DESIGN AND ILLUSTRATIONS</h3>

<p>While the printer has been engaged in putting
the manuscript into type, the publisher has
had a designer at work upon a cover sketch,
and an artist upon such illustrations as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>book requires. All this has to fall in with the
publisher's general scheme for the book as a
whole. The designer must know what limits
are placed upon him as to the number of inks
or foils, or the amount of gold-leaf which he
may employ. The artist must know whether
his pictures are to be drawn for full color,
two-color or one-color plates. In deciding
these questions, the publisher is influenced
by what he believes the book to require in its
appeal to the public, and how great an expense
is warranted by the probability of its success.</p>

<h3>ENGRAVING</h3>

<p>The illustrations in all except the most
pretentious volumes are either halftone or
lineplate photo-engravings. In making a
halftone plate, the picture or object to be
reproduced is photographed through a screen
consisting of a glass plate, diagonally ruled at
right angles in two directions with lines numbering
from fifty to four hundred to the inch.
This screen is placed inside of the camera and
in front of, and very near, the chemically sensitized
plate. The light reflected from the
object to be photographed, varying in intensity
according to the lights and shadows of
the object, is focused on the sensitized plate
through the intervening line screen, and affects
the sensitized film more or less according to
its intensity. This causes a chemical change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
of such nature that the next following operations,
the development and the intensification
of the picture, result in producing it in the
form of dots and stipples varying in size,
and consequently in the respective light and
shade effects, according to the varying lights
and shadows of the original. Inasmuch as the
lights show dark and the darks light, the picture
on the glass makes a negative of the subject.
This negative is placed in a printing
frame, in close contact with a polished copper
plate prepared with a film sensitive to the
light. A few minutes' exposure to the light
renders insoluble in water those parts of the
film which the light has reached through the
negative, and when the other parts of the film,
which remain soluble in water, are washed
away, the picture appears clear on the surface
of the plate. The dots and the stipples forming
the picture are then further treated to
enable them to resist the action of the solution
of iron perchloride to which the plate is next
subjected, which etches out the spaces between
the dots, and leaves the latter in relief.
As the etching on the copper must be in reverse
as regards right and left, in order that it may
appear in proper relation when printed on the
paper, the negative must be produced through
a reflecting prism, or the finished negative,
properly toughened, must be stripped from
the glass on which it has been produced, and
turned over. In ordinary practice, a number
of such turned negatives are placed together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
on a single large glass, and exposed together
on a large copper plate, to be cut apart afterwards
and mounted separately. The primary
etching is usually supplemented by further
processes, such as re-etching, vignetting, hand-tooling
and routing. The finished plate is
finally mounted on a wooden block to the
height of type.</p>

<p>Illustrations in full color are reproduced
from corresponding originals, usually paintings
in oil or water-color, by means of the three-<a name="FNanchor_40b_40b" id="FNanchor_40b_40b"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> or
four-color<a name="FNanchor_40c_40c" id="FNanchor_40c_40c"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> process of reproduction. The plates
for this purpose are usually all halftone, but
are sometimes a combination of halftones
and Benday<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> plates. Two-color halftones
have either a tint background, or secondary
plate in tint, the latter forming the underground
upon which the keyplate is printed in
black. In the three-color process, the respective
plates are printed in yellow, red and blue
successively over one another. In the four-color
process a fourth plate is used to emphasize
the blacks of the picture, the plate being
virtually a keyplate, combining all the features
of the subject, printed on top of the other three
colors, usually in black or dark gray.</p>

<p>It is of particular importance that the engraver
who is to make the halftone plates
should be informed as to the kind of paper
they are to be printed on. A 50-line halftone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>plate will print on almost anything, but is too
coarse to render the details of the picture, and
is usually applied only for newspaper use. It
would be entirely too coarse for the purpose
of book illustration. On the other hand, a
halftone plate made through a screen of 400
lines to the inch can be printed satisfactorily
only upon paper of the highest surface, and with
correspondingly careful presswork. For super-calendered
or English-finish paper, plates
made through a 133-line screen are most advisable,
while the average coated or enameled
paper will take 150-line halftones to best
advantage.</p>

<p>Lineplates are etchings in relief on plates
of zinc or copper, reproduced from pen-and-ink-drawings,
or diagrams, by photo-mechanical
process. The method in general is the same
as that for halftone work, but without the
intervention of the screen. In lineplates, the
light and shade effects are produced by gradations
of thick and thin lines, in distinction
from the effects of wash-drawings and photographs,
which are produced by gradations of
tone. The latter require the intervention of
the screen to convert the full tone gradations
into the halftone of the dots and stipples,
while the former may, as already noted, be
reproduced directly.</p>

<p>Other classes of engravings, of a more costly
kind, and which are therefore used only in
books of more expensive character, are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
various forms of engraving in intaglio; that is
to say, in effects produced by cutting or etching
the design into and below the surface of
the plate, instead of cutting or etching away
the ground, and leaving the design in relief.
Examples of this order are the old-time copperplate
engraving, the more modern steel-engraving,<a name="FNanchor_41a_41a" id="FNanchor_41a_41a"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
in the form of line or mezzotint effects,<a name="FNanchor_41b_41b" id="FNanchor_41b_41b"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
photogravure,<a name="FNanchor_41c_41c" id="FNanchor_41c_41c"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and the yet more recent photo-intaglio
process known as rotogravure,<a name="FNanchor_41d_41d" id="FNanchor_41d_41d"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and
photo-mezzotint.</p>

<h3>DIE CUTTING</h3>

<p>Dies,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> generally required for stamping the
covers of books in gilt letters and designs, are
cut in brass by hand or by finely adjusted routing-machines,
the design being drawn upon the
metal by an artist, or transferred to it by
photography. In the case of very elaborate
designs, the dies are first etched by nitric acid
or iron perchloride, and the more open or less
intricate spaces then deepened by hand, or
by the routing-machines.</p>

<h3>THE PAPER</h3>

<p>In selecting the paper for the book, the publisher
must consider the surface required by
his plates, the weight necessary to give a
proper bulk in proportion to the size of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
volume, and the quality as regulated by the
price. The average book, with no text illustrations,
is printed on wove<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> paper of antique
finish, which is a fairly rough surface, giving
a maximum bulk. A 12mo<a name="FNanchor_42b_42b" id="FNanchor_42b_42b"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> book should
bulk 1 to 1⅛ inches, a 10mo<a name="FNanchor_42c_42c" id="FNanchor_42c_42c"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> book, 1⅛ to 1¼
inches. If the book runs more than an average
length, a medium-or a plate-finish paper may
be used, and the weight per ream is regulated
by the number of pages in each volume and
the bulk required.</p>

<p>Lineplates print satisfactorily on medium-finish
paper, and even on antique-finish if the
lines are not too fine. Halftones require English-finish,<a name="FNanchor_42d_42d" id="FNanchor_42d_42d"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
super-calendered<a name="FNanchor_42e_42e" id="FNanchor_42e_42e"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> or coated<a name="FNanchor_42f_42f" id="FNanchor_42f_42f"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> paper.
Inserts<a name="FNanchor_42g_42g" id="FNanchor_42g_42g"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> are almost always printed upon coated
paper.</p>

<p>Laid<a name="FNanchor_42h_42h" id="FNanchor_42h_42h"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> paper is used in more expensive books,
as, from its nature, better and more costly
stock is required in its making.</p>

<h3>THE PRESSWORK</h3>

<p>Books are printed in forms<a name="FNanchor_42i_42i" id="FNanchor_42i_42i"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of 4 pages and
multiples of 4 pages, depending upon the size
of the paper leaf. The usual form is 32 pages,
so the publisher tries to plan his volume to
make approximately even forms. To print
any number of pages over an even form is as
expensive as to print the complete 32 pages.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

BASTARD-TITLE</h3>

<p>The bastard-title, which is often wrongly
called the half-title, is a modern evolution in
its present application. Originally, this single-line
title was the only title which existed, but
as time went on the demand of the public, on
the one hand, for a decorated page at the
beginning of the book, together with the
printer's desire, on the other hand, to advertise
himself, developed the bastard-title into
the dimensions of the title-page which we
now know, containing the name of the book,
the name of the author, the publisher's device,
and the publisher's name and address. At
the present time the bastard-title is used more
to add elegance to the appearance of the volume
than for any practical purpose, it being
pleasanter for the eye to rest first upon this
page rather than at once upon the title-page,
which extends over the full dimensions of the
type area.</p>

<h3>ADVERTISING CARD</h3>

<p>If an advertising card or limit notice is
required, this page of display should be set
up with careful consideration of the page it is
to face, and of the typography of the book of
which it is to be a part. Too frequently advertising
cards are looked upon as separate jobs,
and are set in types which do not harmonize
with the typography of the rest of the book.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>

TITLE-PAGE</h3>

<p>The title-page offers the printer and the publisher
a tempting opportunity for display and for
artistic typography, and too few realize the
value of restraint. Cobden-Sanderson once remarked,
as explaining the high prices which he
secures for his work, that he always charges more
for what he leaves out than for what he puts in.</p>

<p>The earliest volumes lacked the title-page,
because vellum and linen paper were held so
high that the expense of an extra leaf was considered
an unnecessary luxury. In these books
that which took the place of the title was at
the end, the colophon being in evidence, indicating
the name of the illuminator, if not
always that of the printer. As was the case
with the manuscript book, the volume began
with the phrase, "Here beginneth...."
Later came piratical reprints, which resulted in
making the critical reader insist upon having
each volume stamped with the printer's name or
mark, as a guarantee of reliable workmanship.</p>

<p>The first definite step in the direction of the
title-page is marked by bibliographers in a
little volume printed by Arnold Ther Hoernen,
of Cologne, in 1470. It consisted of an introduction
at the head of a page, the major part
of which was left blank. Whether the printer
forgot to place the usual introduction at the
head of the first page, and took this way to
remedy his error, is not known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>

In general, different faces of type should
never be combined upon the title-page, the
variations being secured by using smaller sizes
of the same face, or harmonizing fonts. Capitals
and lower-case letters can be successfully
combined on the title-page only as a result of
care and thought, the best title-pages usually
being all in lower-case or all in caps and small
caps. A two-color title-page is rarely a success
unless it was originally composed with
two colors in mind, instead of being set up in
black and arbitrarily split up for colors.</p>

<p>The decoration should never overbalance
the type, and this applies as well to the question
of borders on decorated books. No
matter how beautiful, if the decoration overbalances
the type, the volume or the title-page
ceases to be an example of typography and
becomes something answerable only to itself.</p>

<h3>COPYRIGHT</h3>

<p>On the reverse of the title-page is ordinarily
placed the copyright notice of the volume,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
usually a little above the center, set in caps
and small caps, or in small caps alone. At
the foot of this same page the printer usually
places his imprint.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
DEDICATION</h3>

<p>The dedication is a page set in the monumental
style, generally in small capitals.
This must always be a right-hand page, and
the reverse must always be blank.</p>

<h3><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h3>

<p>Ordinarily the preface is set in the same size
of type as the body. If it is written by some
one other than the author, it is frequently set
in italic to mark the distinction. This is
particularly true in case the book contains an
introduction as well. If the preface is of
unusual importance, it is sometimes customary
to have it set in type one size larger than the
body, or double-leaded.</p>

<h3>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h3>

<p>After the preface and before the list of illustrations
comes the contents, occupying whatever
number of pages may be necessary. The
style of its composition is dependent entirely
upon the subject-matter and the typographical
arrangement of the volume.</p>

<h3>LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS</h3>

<p>This follows the contents, and is always set
in a style conforming to the contents page or
pages.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>See remarks under "<a href="#PREFACE">Preface</a>."</p>

<h3>HALF-TITLE</h3>

<p>The half-title ordinarily consists of a single
line, standing by itself on the first page of the
leaf immediately preceding the first page of
the text, and carries the title of the book as at
the top of the first page of text. It is frequently
confused with the bastard or false-title,
which always precedes the title-page. Half-titles
may also run through the book before
various divisions, but the bastard-title never
moves from its one position at the beginning
of the volume.</p>

<h3>LIMIT NOTICE</h3>

<p>If an edition be limited in number, the
notice of such limit should be placed either
on the page facing the bastard-title or on the
reverse of the bastard-title.</p>

<h3>IN GENERAL</h3>

<p>The front matter is often put into type after
the composition of the body has been completed,
so that the number of pages is rarely
definitely determined at the beginning of the
work. For this reason, publishers have favored
the expedient of numbering the preliminary
pages with roman folios, using the arabic folios<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
for the text itself. The front matter and the
chapter pages running through the book offer
opportunities for embellishment and distinctive
typographical treatment, and therefore
should be kept in exact accord, whether elaborate
decorations are used or the severest
form of typographical simplicity.</p>

<h3>MARGINS</h3>

<p>A feature not to be overlooked in the appearance
of a well-printed book is that of the margins.
The perfect type-page is supposed to
be proportioned in such a way that its diagonal
is twice its width. With this page as a basis,
the location of the type upon the paper leaf
is to be studied carefully. In general, the two
pages, right and left, should be considered as
a unit, and the top margin and the inside
margin of each page should be approximately
the same. Doing this, the total blank between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
the two pages is supposed approximately to
equal the outside and the bottom margins.</p>

<p>The proportion of margin is, to a certain
extent, dependent upon the size of the book,
the margins becoming greater as the volume
increases from the thirty-two mo size up to
the folio. A student of typography has ingeniously
estimated that, taking the height
of the paper leaf as 100 units, the height of
the type page of the ordinary trade book
should be from 72% to 75%; that of a library
edition, from 66% to 71%; that of a de luxe
volume, from 60% to 65%.</p>

<h2><a id="MAKING_THE_INDEX"></a>MAKING THE INDEX</h2>

<p class="dropcap">EVERY book of a permanent nature, or
intended as a work of reference, requires an
index. The length of the Index, or its minuteness,
depends upon the nature of the subject
treated, and the importance of making it
easily available to the reader. The Index
belongs to the same family as the Table of
Contents, and the Topical Analyses often
placed at the beginning of each chapter: the
Contents gives a general idea of the divisions
into which the author has separated his subject;
the Topical Analyses still further divide
each chapter; and the Index is ordinarily still
more minute, with the further advantage of
having its references arranged in alphabetical
order.</p>

<p>The proper person to make an index is, first
of all, the author of the book, provided that he
possesses the natural characteristics. It does
not at all naturally follow, however, that all
authors are competent to do this, for the art
of indexing is not as simple as many superficially
suppose. The author should be the
one best fitted, because he knows better than
any reader the exact meaning each of his sentences
is intended to convey,&mdash;and this
meaning should be expressed in the index.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
The ideal index is that which gives every topic,
thought, or reference contained in the book
itself, without a single superfluous word, and
with no description or comment.</p>

<p>To make an index requires a quick grasp of
the idea contained in each sentence or paragraph,
an immediate discernment of the main
thought, an instinctive classification, absolute
accuracy in translating this thought into its
briefest expression, ability to condense, and
a sensing of the reader's needs in adequate
cross-references. All this demands a mind
more logical and more sensitive to codified
detail than is possessed by many able writers.
Under these circumstances, it is desirable to
place the making of the index in the hands
of one possessing these qualifications, either
instinctively or as a result of experience.</p>

<p>Every publishing-house and most printing
establishments of any consequence are in a
position to have indexes prepared when required,
but the danger is always present that
the indexer, approaching his subject from the
outside, will fail to place himself sufficiently
in the author's attitude, and thus lessen the
value of his work. It is most desirable, in
order to prevent this, that the author carefully
inspect the index while in manuscript. He
can thus detect possible departures in the
indexer's condensed expression of his own
thought.</p>

<p>The following rules and suggestions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
given with a twofold object in mind: <i>first</i>,
to prevent those authors who possess the
necessary qualifications from avoiding the preparation
of their own indexes because of unfamiliarity
with the technical details; <i>second</i>, to
enable authors intelligently to criticize the form
as well as the matter of those indexes which
are prepared for their volumes by other hands.</p>

<h3>WHAT TO INDEX</h3>

<p>The closeness with which a book is to be
indexed depends partly upon the nature of its
contents and partly upon the ideas of the
author or publisher. Some indexes contain
only the page references; some are so analytical
that a reader can gain an excellent idea of
the subject-matter itself. These, however,
represent the two extremes. The ordinary
index aims to give every reference necessary
to enable the reader to locate easily the subject-matter
for which he searches, but not a synopsis
of that subject-matter. The entries should
cover, then, with more or less minuteness, as
desired, the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Proper names, whether of persons, places, religious or political
bodies, etc.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Events and periods.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Titles of books to which reference is made.</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) Specific topics or subjects.</li>
<li>(<i>e</i>) Definitions.</li>
<li>(<i>f</i>) Vital statements.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>

PLAN</h3>

<p>The indexer should decide definitely in his
mind just what his procedure is to be before
actually beginning work. At first, it is well
to make the index too full rather than the
reverse, as it is easier to cut out than to fill in.
Most important of all, he must be sure that
the matter to be indexed is clearly understood
before he attempts to transcribe the idea.
The character of the book to be indexed must
be carefully considered, taking into account
the class of people who will probably consult it,
and the lines on which they will probably seek
information.</p>

<p>Judgment is required in deciding whether
it is wise to choose the exact words of the
author or to condense the idea into other
words. In technical books, the exact wording
is sometimes essential, but otherwise it is more
important to express the <i>idea</i> than the exact
terms in which it is expressed.</p>

<p>Always prefer simple words and expressions
to those which are unusual and cumbersome.</p>

<p>Omit every unessential word.</p>

<p>When the book being indexed is one written
upon a specific subject, this main subject should
not be indexed unless necessary to indicate
some reference for which a searcher would look.
Ordinarily, the Contents covers this point rather
than the Index.</p>

<p>Bear in mind particularly the two extremes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the importance of including every reference necessary
to enable the searcher to find what he
wishes without delay or confusion, the mistake
of overloading the index with useless entries.</p>

<p>Use ink, as pencil entries often become illegible.</p>

<p>Write plainly, and do not try to economize
space in preparing the copy.</p>

<h3>DEFINITION OF TERMS</h3>

<p><b>Subject</b>: includes events, places, persons,
facts, definitions or topics: e.g., <i>Boston, 7</i>;
<i>Bonnet, Father, 155</i>; <i>Huron Mission, plans for,
129</i>; <i>Onontio, meaning of, 102</i>; <i>Absolutism,
contest with liberty, 274.</i></p>

<p><b>Heading</b>: the word or words used by the
indexer to express the subject or idea. In
the examples above, the headings are <i>Boston</i>,
<i>Bonnet</i>, <i>Father</i>, <i>Onontio</i>, etc.</p>

<p><b>Entry</b>: the amplification of the Heading,
with the addition of the supplementary phrase.
In the example above, the entry is <i>Absolutism,
contest with liberty</i>, the supplementary
phrase being <i>contest with liberty</i>.</p>

<p><b>Cross-reference</b>: a heading referring to an
entry: e.g., <i>Michabou.</i> See <i>Manabozho</i>.</p>

<h3>PROCEDURE</h3>

<p>Having settled upon a definite plan, the
indexer seats himself at a good-sized table, and
lays out his materials in front of him. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
testing every possible method, the present
writer strongly urges the use of individual
slips of paper, about 2½ inches by 4 inches.
Arranged within easy reach in front of the
indexer, but leaving room for the proof-sheets,
should be twenty small pasteboard boxes,<a name="FNanchor_48a_48a" id="FNanchor_48a_48a"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
a little larger than the slips themselves.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> On
the inside bottom of each box mark a letter of
the alphabet, combining O and Q, U and V,
and X Y Z. As soon as a slip is written, throw
it into its proper box, and continue throughout
the work. It is a false economy to search out
the slips for subsequent entries, unless they
can be easily found, as it is a simple matter at
the end to combine the several slips which
belong to the same heading.</p>

<p>Here are sample slips, showing a heading
which requires full entries and one to which
the text contains fewer references. The first
shows a slip on which the various entries have
been combined:</p>
<div class="bboxsimple">
<p class="hang">

 Andastes, the, 5; location and characteristics of,
   36; synonyms of, 36; plans for converting, 130;
   war with Mohawks, 147; Hurons ask aid from,
   162; mortal quarrel with Mohawks, 163; promise
   to aid Hurons, 163; Huron fugitives try to reach,
   240, 250; Mohawks first to bear brunt of war
   with, 268; receive aid from Swedish colonists, 268;
   attack Senecas, 269; courage their only strength
   270; finally overborne by Senecas, 270.

</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
This slip shows the method of indexing a
work in more than one volume:</p>

<div class="bboxsimple"><p class="hang">

 James, Edwin, gives account of Nanabush, i. 67;
   on Indian ideas of another life, ii. 79.
</p></div>

<p>In the rules which follow, the basis adopted
is "Cutter's Rules for a Dictionary Catalogue,"<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
prepared for library cataloguing. Such portion
as applies to book indexing has been freely
drawn upon, adapted and added to from the
present writer's experience.</p>

<h3>ARRANGEMENT</h3>

<p>When, under a single entry, there are both
subject-references and references by folios only,
place the folio-references together at the end
of the entry, following the subject-references.</p>

<p>Arrange entries according to the English
alphabet, whatever the order of the alphabet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>in which a foreign name might have been
entered in its original language.</p>

<p>Arrange German names spelled with the
vowels ä, ö, ü as if spelled ae, oe, ue, but retain
the form employed by the author.</p>

<p>When the same word serves for several kinds
of entries, the order should be as follows:
person, place, subject, title: e.g., (1) <i>Brown,
G. F.</i> (person). (2) <i>Brown Village</i> (place).
(3) <i>Brown-tail Moth</i> (subject). (4) <i>Brown
Family, the</i> (title).</p>

<p>Forenames precede surnames: e.g., <i>Francis
I</i> precedes <i>Francis, Charles</i>.</p>

<h3>ADJECTIVE-HEADINGS</h3>

<p>In general, a noun or a substantive phrase
should be selected for the heading, but when
an adjective forms part of a name or well-known
term, the entry should include it: e.g.,
<i>Alimentary canal, hereditary genius, perpetual
motion</i>, etc.</p>

<h3>SUBJECT-MATTER</h3>

<p>It is not possible to formulate rules for indexing
subject-matter as definitely as has already
been done with names, places, etc. The
judgment of the indexer and his analytical
skill will be called fully into play. The effort
should be to express in the index, in the clearest
yet briefest form, the <i>idea</i> which the author
has amplified in his text. As an aid to the
nature and form of the entries, a page of text
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
is shown on the opposite page, and the entries
which would appear in the index from this
page, are given below. This is what would
be considered as a medium full index:</p>

<ul>
<li class="hang">Bressani, Joseph, tortured by Iroquois, 73; life spared by Iroquois,
73; sent to Fort Orange, 73; ransomed by Dutch, 73; sent to Rochelle,
73.</li>

<li>Dutch, the, ransom Bressani, 73.</li>

<li>Indian Torture, See <i>Torture, Indian</i>.</li>

<li>Iroquois Indians, the, torture Bressani, 73; spare Bressani's life, 73.</li>

<li>Jogues, Isaac, referred to, 73.</li>

<li>Orange, Fort, Bressani sent to, 73.</li>

<li>Rochelle, Bressani sent to, 73.</li>

<li>Torture, Indian, Bressani by the Iroquois, 73.</li>

</ul>

<p class="right">73</p>
<p class="center">
ESCAPE OF BRESSANI
</p>

<p>march of several days,&mdash;during which Bressani,
in wading a rocky stream, fell from exhaustion
and was nearly drowned,&mdash;they reached an Iroquois
town. It is needless to follow the revolting
details of the new torments that succeeded. They
hung him by the feet with chains; placed food for
their dogs on his naked body, that they might
lacerate him as they ate; and at last had reduced
his emaciated frame to such a condition that even
they themselves stood in horror of him. "I
could not have believed," he writes to his Superior,
"that a man was so hard to kill." He found
among them those who, from compassion or from
a refinement of cruelty, fed him, for he could not
feed himself. They told him jestingly that they
wished to fatten him before putting him to
death.</p>

<p class="in">The council that was to decide his fate met on
the nineteenth of June, when to the prisoner's
amazement, and, as it seemed, to their own surprise,
they resolved to spare his life. He was
given, with due ceremony, to an old woman, to
take the place of a deceased relative; but since
he was as repulsive, in his mangled condition as,
by the Indian standard, he was useless, she sent
her son with him to Fort Orange, to sell him to
the Dutch. With the same humanity which
they had shown in the case of Jogues, they
gave a generous ransom for him, supplied him
with clothing, kept him until his strength was in
some degree recruited, and then placed him on
board a vessel bound for Rochelle. Here he</p>

RULES AND EXAMPLES</h3>

<p><b>Names:</b></p>

<p><big>Index under the Christian name or forename:</big></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Sovereigns, popes, queens, princes and princesses.
<i>Exceptions</i>: Greek or Roman sovereigns, princes of
the French Empire.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Persons canonized: e.g., <i>Thomas a Becket, Saint</i>.</p>

<p>Also make cross-reference: e.g., <i>Becket, Thomas a.</i>
See <i>Thomas a Becket</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Friars required by the constitution of their
order to relinquish their surname: e.g., <i>Paolino da S.
Bartolomeo</i>.</p>

<p>Also make cross-reference under family name: e.g.,
<i>Wesdin, J.P.</i> See <i>Paolino da S. Bartolomeo</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Persons known only by their first names, whether
or not their profession, rank or native place be added:
e.g., <i>Michelangelo Buonarroti</i>, <i>Rembrandt van Rhijn</i>.</p>

<p>Cross-reference under family name is optional, dependent
upon closeness of indexing.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Oriental authors, including Jewish rabbis: e.g.,
<i>Abu Bakr ibn Badr</i>.</p>

<p>This rule has many exceptions. Some Oriental
writers are known and should be entered under other
parts of their name than the first, as "<i>Abu-l-Kasim,
Khalaf ibn Abbas</i>," <i>Firdusi, Abul Kasim</i>, etc., <i>known
as</i>, or under some appellation as "<i>al-Masudi</i>," "<i>at-Tabari</i>."</p>

<p>In Arabic names, the words of relationship <i>Abu</i>
(father), <i>Umm</i> (mother), <i>Ibn</i>, <i>Bin</i> (son), <i>Ahu</i> (brother),
though not to be treated as names by themselves, are
yet not to be disregarded. They form a name in conjunction
with the word following (e.g., <i>Abu Bakr</i>), and
determine the alphabetical place of the entry. But
the article <i>al</i> (changed by assonance to <i>ad</i>-, <i>ar</i>-, <i>as</i>-, <i>at</i>-,
<i>az</i>-, according to the letter it precedes) is neglected
(al- <i>Masudi</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
In all Oriental names, the indexer must be careful
not to take titles, as <i>Emir, Bey, Pasha, Sri, Babu,
Pundit</i>, for names.</p>

<p>In regard to East Indian names, Dr. Feigl gives the
rule: If there are two names, enter under the first,
which is the individual name, with a cross-reference
from the second; if there are three or more, enter under
the third, which is the family name, with a cross-reference
under the first or individual name; the second
may be neglected.</p>

<p class="p2"><big>Index under the surname:</big></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In general, all persons not included under previous
rules.</p>

<p>In a few cases, chiefly of artists, a universally-used
sobriquet is to be taken in place of the family or forename,
as <i>Tintoretto</i> (whose real name was Giacomo
<i>Robusti</i>). Similar cases are <i>Canaletto</i> (Antonio <i>Canale</i>
and also B. <i>Belotto</i>), <i>Correggio</i> (Ant. <i>Allegri</i>), <i>Garofalo</i>
(Benvenuto Piero <i>Tisi</i>), Il <i>Sodoma</i> (Giov. Ant. <i>Bazzi</i>),
<i>Spagnoletto</i> (Jusepe <i>Ribera</i>, now however oftener called
<i>Ribera</i>), <i>Uccello</i> (Paolo <i>Doni</i>). Always cross-reference
from the family name.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In particular, ecclesiastical dignitaries: e.g.,
<i>Kaye</i>, John, Bishop of Lincoln. <i>Lincoln</i>, John, Bishop
of. See <i>Kaye</i>.</p>

<p>Bishops usually omit their family name, canons their
forename: e.g., <i>Canon Liddon</i>, <i>Bishop of Ripon, Henry
Edward</i>, <i>Archbishop of Westminster</i>, i.e., <i>H. E. Manning</i>.
Care must be taken not to treat Canon as a forename
or Edward as a family name.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Married women, using the known form:</p>

<p>Wives often continue writing, and are known in
literature only under their maiden names (as <i>Miss
Freer</i> or <i>Fanny Lewald</i>), or after a second marriage
retain for literary purposes the first husband's name.
Enclose the maiden name in parenthesis: e.g., <i>Ward,
Mrs. Elizabeth (Phelps)</i>. Use the form <i>White, Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>Julia Charlotte, wife of J. C.</i>, when the husband's
name is used: e.g., <i>Hopkins, Mrs Sarah (Drake) Garretson</i>.
<i>Stowe, Mrs. Emily Howard (Jennings)</i>. <i>Soyaux,
Frau Frieda (Schanz)</i>. <i>Gasparin, Valérie (Boissier)
Comtesse de</i>.</p>

<p>Women known under their husbands' names are to be
entered as follows: <i>Hinkson, Mrs. Katherine (Tynan),
Mrs. H. A. Hinkson</i>. Cross-reference to be made from
the latter form.</p>

<p class="p2"><big>Index under the highest title:</big></p>

<p>British and foreign noblemen, with cross-reference
from earlier titles by which they have been known,
and, in the case of British noblemen, from the family
name: e.g., <i>Chesterfield, 4th Earl of (Philip Dormer
Stanhope)</i>. <i>Chesterfield, 5th Earl of (Philip Stanhope)</i>.
Cross-reference from <i>Stanhope</i>. <i>Saint-Simon, Louis de
Rouvroi, Duc de</i>.</p>

<p>Authors should be put under their names. The
definition of a name is "that by which a person or thing
is known." Noblemen are known by their titles, not
by their family names.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>In the few cases in which the family name<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
or a lower title is decidedly better known,
index under that and cross-reference from
the title: e.g., <i>Francis Bacon, Baron
Verulam</i>; <i>Robert Curzon, 14th Baron Zouche</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
<i>John Napier, Baron of Merchiston</i>;
<i>Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Oxford</i>; likewise
the military nobles and princes of the
French Empire: e.g., <i>Lucien Bonaparte,
Prince de Canino</i>; <i>McMahon, Duc de
Magenta</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Englishwomen's titles-of-honor are to be
treated by the following rules. In the
matter of titles an Englishwoman in marrying
has everything to gain and nothing
to lose. If she marries above her own
rank she takes her husband's title in exchange
for her own, if below her own rank
she keeps her own title.</big></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>

(<i>a</i>) The wife of a peer takes her husband's style.</p>

<p>That is, she is Baroness, Viscountess, Marchioness,
etc. In indexing, say <i>Brassey, Annie (Allnutt), Baroness</i>;
not <i>Brassey, Annie (Allnutt), Lady</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The wife of a knight or baronet is <i>Lady</i>. Whether
this title precedes or follows her forename depends
upon whether she had a title before her marriage.</p>

<p>That is, if Lady Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown
(either knight or baronet), she is <i>Lady Mary Brown</i>,
also if Hon. Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (knight
or baronet) she is <i>Lady Mary Brown</i>; but if Miss Mary
Smith marries Sir John Brown (knight or baronet),
she becomes <i>Mary, Lady Brown</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A maid of honor retains her <i>Hon.</i> after marriage,
unless, of course, it is merged into a higher title.</p>

<p>Thus, if she marries a baronet she is the <i>Hon<sup>ble</sup> Lady
Brown</i>; if a peer, the <i>Lady So and So</i>. In either case
as though she had been a peer's daughter.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The wife of an earl's (or higher peer's) younger
son is never the <i>Hon<sup>ble</sup> Lady</i>; if she used the <i>Lady</i>
before marriage in her own right she does not, of
course, add anything by such marriage, but the wife
of a younger son of a lower peer than an earl is
<i>Honᵇˡᵉ Mrs.</i> (not <i>Lady</i>)&mdash;the younger children of all
peers using, of course, the family name, with or
without their forenames, according to their rank.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) If the lady to whom the title <i>Hon.</i> belongs in
virtue of her father's rank marries a commoner, she
retains her title, becoming <i>Hon. Lady</i> if she marries
a knight or baronet, and <i>Hon. Mrs.</i> if her husband has
no title.</p>

<p>None of these courtesy titles is inherited by the
children of those who bear them, the third generation
of even the highest peer being simply commoners unless
raised in rank by marriage or merit.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The title <i>Lady</i> belongs to daughters of all noblemen
not lower than earl.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) The title <i>Hon.</i> belongs to daughters of viscounts
and barons; also to an untitled woman who be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>comes
a maid-of-honor to the Queen, and this title is
retained after she leaves the service. If a woman who
has the title <i>Lady</i> becomes maid-of-honor she does
not acquire the title <i>Hon.</i></p>

<p class="hang p2"><big>Index compound names according to the
usage of the author's fatherland, though
if it is known that his practice differs
from this usage, his preference should be
followed. Compound names then go:</big></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) If English, under the last part of the name,
when the first has not been used alone by the author:
e.g., <i>Gould, Sabine Baring-</i>; but <i>Halliwell (afterwards
Halliwell-Phillipps), J. O.</i>, and <i>Locker (afterwards
Locker-Lampson)</i>, because they are well-known under
the first names.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If foreign, under the first part.</p>

<p>Both such compound names as <i>Gentil-Bernard</i> and
such as <i>Gentil de Chavagnac</i>. There are various exceptions,
when a name has been more known under the
last part, as <i>Fénelon</i>, not <i>Salignac de Lamothe Fénelon</i>;
<i>Voltaire</i>, not <i>Arouet de Voltaire</i>; <i>Sternberg</i>, not <i>Ungern-Sternberg</i>.
Moreover, it is not always easy to determine
what is a compound surname in French. Cross-references
are necessary whichever way one decides
each case, especially when the second part of a foreign
compound name has been used alone, as <i>Merle
d'Aubigné</i> (index under <i>Merle</i> with a cross-reference
from <i>Aubigné</i>).</p>

<p>In French, a forename is sometimes joined to a surname
by a hyphen. In such cases make the entry
under the family name, with a cross-reference from
the forename: e.g., entry, <i>Rochette, Désiré Raoul</i>; cross-reference,
<i>Raoul-Rochette, Désiré</i>. See <i>Rochette</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) In foreign compound names of women also, although
the first part is usually the maiden name and
the second the husband's name, the entry should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>generally be under the first, with a cross-reference
from the second<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>: e.g., <i>Rivé-King</i>, with cross-reference
from <i>King, born Rivé</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><big>Index surnames preceded by prefixes:</big></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In French and Belgian, under the prefix when it
is or contains an article, <i>Le, La, L', Du, Des</i>; under
the word following when the prefix is a preposition,
<i>de, d'</i>: e.g., <i>Des Essarts, Du Cange, La Fontaine, Le
Sage, L'Estoille</i>; but <i>Charlevoix, P. F. X. de</i>; <i>Estrées,
M<sup>me</sup> d'</i>.</p>

<p><i>La</i> and <i>Le</i> are often, <i>Des</i> is usually, and <i>Les</i> is almost
without exception printed as one word with the name
following, as <i>Lafontaine, Lesage, Lesdiguières</i>; <i>de</i> and
<i>d'</i> are sometimes so printed; when they are, enter under
the <i>D</i>: e.g., <i>Debucourt, Decamps, Delisle</i>; but <i>Bucourt,
A. de</i>, <i>Camps, C. de</i>, <i>Lisle, J. de</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In English, under the prefix, no matter from
what language the name is derived, with cross-references
when necessary: e.g., <i>De Quincey</i>, <i>Van Buren</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) In all other languages, under the name following
the prefix, with cross-references whenever the name
has been commonly used in English with the prefix,
as <i>Del Rio</i>, <i>Vandyck, Van Ess</i>: e.g. <i>Gama, Vasco da</i>,
<i>Goethe, J. W. von</i>.</p>

<p>But when the name is printed as one word, entry
is made under the prefix, as <i>Vanderhaeghen</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Naturalized names with prefixes are to be treated
by the rules of the nation adopting them.</p>

<p>Thus German names preceded by <i>von</i>, when belonging
to Russians, are to be entered under <i>Von</i>, as this
is the Russian custom. So when Dutch names compounded
with <i>van</i> are adopted into French or English
(as <i>Van Laun</i>) the <i>Van</i> is treated as part of the family
name.</p>

<p>Prefixes are <i>d', de, de La</i> (the name goes under <i>La</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>not <i>de</i>), <i>Des, Du, L', La, Le, Les, St, Ste</i> (to be arranged
as if written <i>Saint, Sainte</i>), <i>da, dal, dalla, dalle, dai,
dagli, del, della, delle, dei</i> (<i>dé</i> or <i>de</i>), <i>degli, da, dos</i>,
<i>das, ten, ter, thor, Van, vander, van't, ver, am, auf, auf'm,
aus, aus'm, in, im, von, vom, zu, zum, zur, A', Ap, O',
Fitz, Mac</i> (which is to be printed as it is in the title,
whether <i>M'</i>, or <i>Mc</i>, or <i>Mac</i>, but to be arranged as if
written <i>Mac</i>).</p>

<p class="hang p2"><big>Index names of capes, lakes, mountains,
rivers, forts, etc., beginning with <i>Cape</i>,
<i>Lake</i>, <i>Mt.</i>, etc., under the word following
the prefix, but when the name is itself
used as a prefix, do not transpose <i>Cape</i>,
etc., nor in such names as <i>Isle of the Woods</i>,
<i>Isles of Shoals</i>; but there is more reason
for writing <i>France, Isle de</i>; <i>Man, Isle of</i>;
<i>Wight, Isle of</i>: e.g., <i>Cod, Cape</i>; <i>George,
Lake</i>; <i>Washington, Mt.</i>; <i>Moultrie, Fort</i>;
but <i>Cape Breton Island</i>. When the name
of a fort becomes the name of a city, of
course the inversion must be abandoned,
as <i>Fort Wayne</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Forenames are to be used in the form employed
by their owners, however unusual,
as <i>Will Carleton, Sally (Pratt) McLean,
Hans Droysen, Fritz Reuter</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Give names of places in the English form.
(Cross-reference from the vernacular, if
necessary): e.g., <i>Munich</i> not <i>Muenchen</i>
or <i>München</i>, <i>Vienna</i> not <i>Wien</i>, <i>Austria</i>
not <i>Oesterreich</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>But if both the English and the foreign forms
are used by English writers, prefer the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>foreign form: e.g., <i>Dauphiné</i> rather than
<i>Dauphiny</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Use the modern name of a city and cross-reference
to it from the ancient, provided
its existence has been continuous and there
is no doubt as to the identity.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Distinctive epithets are to be in the same
language as the name: e.g.,</big></p>

<p><i>Kniaz, fürst von, Freiherr zu, duc de Magenta, Bishop
of Lincoln, évêque de Meaux</i>; but <i>Emperor of Germany,
King of France</i>, not <i>kaiser</i> and <i>roi</i>, when names of
sovereign princes are given in English. Treat in the
same way patronymics habitually joined with a person's
name; as, <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><big>Prefixes (i.e., titles which in speaking come
before the name), as <i>Hon., Mrs., Rev.</i>,
etc., should in the heading be placed before
the Christian name (as <i>Smith, Capt. John</i>),
and suffixes as <i>Jr., D.D., LL.D.</i>, after it
(as <i>Channing, James Ellery, D.D.</i>).</big></p>

<p>Hereditary titles generally follow the Christian name,
as <i>Derby, Thomas Stanley, 1st earl of</i>; but British
courtesy titles (i.e., those given to the younger sons of
dukes and marquesses) precede, as <i>Wellesley, Lord
Charles (2d son of the Duke of Wellington)</i>. In other
languages than English, French, and German the
title usually precedes the forename; as, <i>Alfieri, Conte
Vittorio</i>. Occasionally a French nobleman uniformly
places his title before his forenames; as, <i>Gasparin,
Comte Agénor de</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lord</i> should be replaced by the exact title in the
names of English noblemen: e.g., Lord Macaulay
should be entered as <i>Macaulay, 1st baron</i>. <i>Lord</i> in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>title of Scotch judges follows the family name; as,
<i>Kames, H. Home, afterwards Lord</i>.</p>

<p>The title Baronet is given in the form <i>Scott, Sir
Walter, bart.</i></p>

<p>Patronymic phrases, as <i>of Dedham</i>, follow all the
names; but they must immediately follow the family
name when they are always used in close connection
with it, as <i>Girault de St. Farjeau, Eusèbe</i>; similarly
<i>aîné</i>, <i>fils</i>, <i>jeune</i>, as <i>Dumas fils, Alexandre</i>; <i>Didot fils,
Ambroise</i>. Latin appellatives should not in general be
separated from their nouns by a comma; as, <i>Caesar
Heisterbacensis</i>.</p>

<p>The name of a king's wife should be written thus:
<i>Charlotte, Queen, consort of George III of England</i>.
<i>Anne Boleyn Queen, 2d consort of Henry VIII of
England.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><b>Countries and places:</b></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Index under countries or places important
events relating to them: e.g., <i>Montreal,
Cartier's description of houses at</i>. Also
make reference under name: e.g., <i>Cartier,
description of houses at Montreal</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter congresses of several nations under
the name of the place of meeting (as that
usually gives them their name), with cross-references
from the nations taking part
in them, and from any name by which they
are popularly known: e.g., the <i>Congress
of London, of Paris, of Verona, International
Peace Congress at the Hague</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter treaties under the name of each of the
contracting parties, with a cross-reference
from the name of the place of negotiation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>when the treaty is commonly called by
that name, and from any other usual
appellation: e.g., treaty of <i>Versailles</i>,
<i>Barrier</i> treaty, <i>Jay's</i> treaty.</big></p>

<p class="p2"><b>Parties and sects:</b></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter the official publications of any political
party or religious denomination or
order, under the name of the party, or
denomination, or order: e.g.,</big></p>

<p>Platforms, manifestoes, addresses, etc., go under
<i>Democratic Party, Republican Party</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Confessions of faith, creeds, catechisms, liturgies,
breviaries, missals, hours, offices, prayer books, etc.,
go under <i>Baptists, Benedictines, Catholic Church, Church
of England, Friends</i>, etc.</p>

<p>That part of a body which belongs to any place
should be entered under the name of the body, not
the place: e.g., <i>Congregationalists in New England</i>,
<i>Congregationalists in Massachusetts</i>, not <i>New England
Congregationalists</i>, <i>Massachusetts Congregationalists</i>.
But cross-references must be made from the place
(indeed in cases like <i>Massachusetts Convention</i>, <i>Essex
Conference</i>, it may be doubted whether those well-known
names should not be the headings).</p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter corporations and quasi corporations,
both English and foreign, under their
names as they read, neglecting an initial
article or serial number when there is one.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter orders of knighthood, both those of
medieval times and their honorary modern
equivalents, under the significant word
of the English title: e.g., <i>Garter, Order of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>the</i>; <i>Malta, Knights of</i>; <i>Templars, Knights</i>;
<i>Teutonic Order</i>; <i>Freemasons</i>. But the
American Knights Templars, being merely
a division of the Freemasons, belong under
<i>Freemasons</i>; so of other regular masonic
bodies.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>The colleges of an English university and
the unnamed professional schools of an
American university go under the university's
name. Such professional schools,
if they have a distinctive name, particularly
if at a distance from the university,
or for any other reason less closely connected
with it, go under their own name:
e.g., <i>Oxford University, Magdalen College</i>;
<i>Harvard University, Veterinary School</i>;
but <i>Barnard College, Columbia University</i>;
<i>Radcliffe College, Harvard University</i>;
<i>Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>College libraries go under the name of the
college: e.g., <i>Harvard College, University
Library</i>. But the Bodleian Library may
be put under <i>Bodleian</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Local college societies go under the name of
the college; intercollegiate societies and
Greek letter fraternities under their own
names: e.g., Φ B K <i>A, of Harvard</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Alumni and Alumnæ associations go under
the name of the school or college: e.g.,
<i>Harvard Alumni Association of New York</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Schools supported by public taxation go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>under the name of the city or town maintaining
them, whether they have an individual
name or not.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>When a corporation is much less known by
the first words of its name than by a later
part, enter under the later part: e.g.,
<i>Christian Endeavor, Young People's Society
of</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter guilds under the name of the trade:
e.g., <i>Stationers Company</i>, not <i>Master and
Keepers or Wardens and Commonality of
the Mystery and Art of Stationers of the
City of London</i>, which is the corporate title.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter bodies whose legal name begins with
such words as <i>Board</i>, <i>Corporation</i>, <i>Trustees</i>
under that part of the name by which
they are usually known: e.g., Trustees of
the <i>Eastern Dispensary</i>; President and
Fellows of <i>Harvard College</i>; Proprietors
of the <i>Boston Athenæum</i>; Contributors
to the <i>Asylum for the Relief of Persons
Deprived of their Reason</i>. Cross-reference
from the first word of the legal name.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter the name of a firm under the family
name rather than the forename, and do
not fill out the forenames: e.g., <i>Friedlander
und Sohn, Raphael</i>, not under
<i>Raphael</i>; <i>Stokes, F. A. Co.</i>, not <i>Stokes,
Frederick A. Co.</i></big></p>

<p>The consulter is much more likely to remember the
family than the Christian name. Whether the Christian
name is written at the end or thus, <i>Town (John)</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>and <i>Bowers (Henry)</i>, all firms should be arranged after
all the other entries of the first family name, i.e.,
<i>Friedlander und Sohn</i> after all the <i>Friedlanders</i>.</p>

<p>This rule might be extended to include corporations,
colleges, libraries, etc., whose legal names include forenames.
Entry under a forename, as <i>Silas Bronson
Library</i>, and especially under initials, as <i>T. B. Scott
Public Library</i>, is awkward. But the public habit is
not yet sufficiently settled to justify an exception.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter the universities of the European continent
and of Central and South America
under the name of the place; all other
societies under <i>Königliche</i>, <i>Herzogliche</i>, etc.</big></p>

<p>Cross-reference from the first word in the university
names and from the place of societies.</p>

<p>A few learned academies, commonly called by the
names of the cities where they are established, may
be entered under the place with a cross-reference from
the name. These are <i>Berlin, Göttingen, Leipzig, Lisbon,
Madrid, Munich, St. Petersburg, Vienna</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter national libraries, museums, and galleries,
as well as libraries, museums, and
galleries instituted or supported by a
city, under the place, provided they have
not a distinctive name.</big></p>

<p>Example of place: <i>Paris Bibliothèque Nationale</i>.
<i>Boston Public Library.</i></p>

<p>Example of name: <i>Berkshire Athenæum</i>; <i>Boston
Athenæum</i>; <i>British Museum</i>; <i>Forbes Library</i>; <i>Marucceliana,
Biblioteca</i>; <i>Reuben Hoar Public Library</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter observatories under the name of the
place: e.g., <i>Greenwich, Observatory</i>. <i>Pulkowa,
Sternwarte</i>; except that:</big></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>

(<i>a</i>) University observatories go under the university:
e.g., <i>Harvard College. Astronomical Observatory,
at Cambridge.</i> (Cross-reference from <i>Cambridge</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Any observatory having an individual name may
go under that: e.g., <i>Lick Observatory</i>, <i>Yerkes Observatory</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter expositions under the place where they
were held: e.g.,</big></p>

<p><i>Buffalo, Pan-American Exposition, 1901</i>; <i>Chicago,
World's Columbian Exposition, 1893</i>; <i>New Orleans,
World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exhibition,
1884-85</i>; <i>Philadelphia, Centennial Exhibition, 1876</i>.</p>

<p>Cross-reference from an individual name.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter American State universities and State
historical, agricultural and medical societies,
whether supported by the State or
not, under the name of the State, unless
they are better known by a distinctive
name. The State's name usually enters
into the name of these societies and they
are known outside of the State by its name.
Cross-reference when necessary.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Enter churches under the name of the place.</big></p>

<p>Single churches have usually been entered under the
place, a practice which arose in American indexes from
our way of naming churches "The First Church in&mdash;&mdash;," "The
Second Church of&mdash;&mdash;," etc., and applies
very well to a majority of English churches, whose
name generally includes the name of the parish. It is
more in accordance with indexing principles to limit
the local entry of churches to <i>First Church</i>, etc., and
those which have only the name of the town or parish,
and to put all others (as <i>St. Sepulchre's</i>, <i>St. Mary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>Aldermansbury</i>) under their names, as they read, and
to treat convents and monasteries in the same way;
but the convenience of having a single definite rule
has been held to outweigh in this case the claims of
consistency.</p>

<p>The parishes of London (as <i>Kensington</i>, <i>Marylebone</i>,
<i>Southwark</i>), like the parts of Boston (<i>Dorchester</i>,
<i>Roxbury</i>, etc.), or of any other composite city, would
be put under their own names, not under the name of
the city.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>A few cathedrals generally known by some
other name may be entered under it: e.g.,
<i>St. Paul's, London; Notre Dame, Paris;
St. Peter's, Rome; St. Sophia, Constantinople</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Put monasteries and convents, like churches,
under the place, unless better known by
the name.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>National banks designated merely by number
(as <i>First National Bank of Boston</i>)
go under the name of the place.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Young men's Christian associations, mercantile
library associations, and the like,
should have local entry.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Private schools having no distinctive name
go under the name of the proprietor.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Private libraries, galleries and museums go
under the name of the proprietor.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>Buildings are for the most part provided for
in the above rules, as museums, galleries,
libraries, churches, etc. Any others
should be entered under their names, with
a cross-reference from the city.</big></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
<big>Headings like <i>Charles</i>, <i>George</i>, <i>Henry</i>, when
very numerous, must be divided into
classes, in this order: Saints, Popes, Emperors,
Kings, Princes, and Noblemen,
others. The Saints are sub-arranged by
their usual appellatives, the Popes by
their number, Sovereigns and Sovereign
princes in alphabetical order of countries,
and under countries numerically. Other
persons are sub-arranged by their usual appellatives,
neglecting the prepositions:</big><a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> <big>e.g.,</big></p>

<li><i>Peter</i>, the Great, Emperor of Russia.</li>
<li><i>Peter II</i>, of Aragon.</li>

<li><i>Peter-Hansen</i>, Erik.</li>
<li><i>Peter</i> Lewis, a true tale.</li>
</ul>

<p>When there are two appellatives coming in different
parts of the alphabet, cross-reference from the rejected
one, as <i>Thomas Cantuariensis</i>. See <i>Thomas Becket</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>Arrange in two alphabets names that differ
slightly in spelling and come close together
in the alphabet: e.g.,</big></p>

<p><i>Brown</i> and <i>Browne</i>, and the French names beginning
with <i>Saint</i> and <i>Sainte</i>. As readers may not always
know the spelling of the author's name, cross-references
should be made: e.g., <i>Brown</i>. See also <i>Browne</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>

<big>Arrange by the forename headings in which
the family name is the same.</big></p>

<p>No attention is to be paid to prefixes, as <i>Bp., Capt.,
Dr., Hon., Sir, Fräulein, Miss, Mlle., Mme., Mrs.</i>,
or to suffixes, as <i>D.D., F.R.S., LL.D.</i>, etc.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>When the forenames are the same, arrange
chronologically.</big></p>

<p>No attention is to be paid to the titles <i>Sir</i>, etc.:
e.g., <i>Bart, T. L.</i>, comes before <i>Bart, Thomas</i>, for the
same reason that <i>Bart</i> comes before <i>Barta</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>Forenames not generally used should be
neglected in the arrangement.</big></p>

<p>When an author is generally known by one of several
forenames he will be looked for by that alone, and that
alone should determine the arrangement. The form
should be <i>Harte, Bret</i> (in full <i>Francis Bret</i>), or <i>Harte,
Bret</i> (i.e., <i>Francis Bret</i>).</p>

<p>Make cross-references whenever the omission of a
name will change the alphabetical arrangement, as
from <i>Müller, F. Max</i>, to <i>Müller, Max</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>When there are two names exactly the
same, add dates if available: e.g., <i>Franklin,
John (d. 1759)</i>; <i>Franklin, John (d.
1863)</i>.</big></p>

<p class="hang"><big>If an author uses both the shorter and the
longer forms in different works, and yet is
decidedly better known by the shorter,
arrange by that.</big></p>

Motte Fouqué, Le Sage, Mac Fingal, O'Neal, Saint-Réal, Sainte-Beuve,
Van Buren</i>.</p>


<p>This is the universal custom, founded on the fact
that the prefixes are often not separated in printing
from the following part of the name. It would, of
course, be wrong to have <i>Demorgan</i> in one place and
<i>De Morgan</i> in another.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>Arrange proper names beginning with <i>M',

</ul>

<p class="hang"><big>Arrange incomplete names by the letters.
When the same letters are followed by
different signs, if there are no forenames,
arrange in the order of the complexity of
signs; but if there are forenames, arrange
by them: i.e., put a dot before a line, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>line before a star (three lines crossing),
etc.: e.g.,</big></p>

<ul>
<li><i>Far</i> from the world.</li>
<li><i>Far</i> ...</li>
<li><i>Far</i> ***</li>
<li><i>Far</i>, *** B. F.</li>
<li><i>Far</i> ..., J. B.</li>
<li><i>Farr</i>, John.</li>
</ul>

<p class="hang"><big>The arrangement of title-entries is first by
the heading words; if they are the same,
then by the next word; if that is the same,
by the next; and so on. Every word,
articles and prepositions included, is to
be regarded, but not a transposed article:
e.g.,</big></p>

<ul>
<li><i>Uncovenanted</i> Mercies.</li>
<li><i>Under</i> a Cloud.</li>
<li><i>Under</i> the Ban.</li>
<li><i>Under</i> the Greenwood Tree; a novel. </li>
<li><i>Under</i> the Greenwood Tree; a poem.</li>

<li><i>Undone</i> Task Done.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
</li></ul>

<p>It makes no difference whether the words are connected
with one another in sense or not; the searcher
should not be compelled to think of that. Let the
arrangement be by words as ordinarily printed. Thus
<i>Home Rule</i> is one idea but it is two words, and its place
must be determined primarily by its first word <i>Home</i>,
which brings it before <i>Homeless</i>. If it were printed
<i>Homerule</i> it would come after <i>Homeless</i>. Similarly
<i>Art Amateur</i> is one phrase, but as the first word <i>Art</i>
is followed by a word beginning with <i>am</i>, it must come
before <i>Art</i> and <i>Artists</i>, although its parts are more
closely connected than the parts of the latter phrase.</p>

<p>The French <i>d'</i> and <i>l'</i> are not to be treated as part of
the following word: e.g.,</p>

<ul>

<li class="isub1">

<li class="isub1"><i>Art digne.</i></li>
<li class="isub1"><i>Art d'instruire.</i></li>
</ul>

<p class="hang"><big>Arrange titles beginning with numeral
figures as if the figures were written out
in the language of the rest of the title: e.g.,</big></p>

<p>100 deutscher Männer&mdash;Ein hundert deutsche
Männer; 1812&mdash;Mil huit cent douze.</p>

<p class="hang"><big>Arrange abbreviations as if spelled in full,
but elisions as they are printed: e.g.,</big></p>

<p><i>Dr., M., Mlle., Mme., Mr., Mrs., St., as Doctor,
Monsieur, Mademoiselle, Madame, Mister, Mistress,
Saint</i>.</p>

<ul>
<li>But <i>Who'd be a king?</i></li>
 <li class="isub1"><i>Who killed Cock Robin?</i></li>
 <li class="isub1"><i>Who's to blame?</i></li>
</ul>

<p class="hang"><big>Care must be taken not to mix two subjects
together because their names are spelled
in the same way.</big></p>

<p>Thus <i>Grace</i> before meals, <i>Grace</i> of body, <i>Grace</i> the
musical term, and <i>Grace</i> the theological term, must be
four distinct headings.</p>

<p><b>Offset Printing</b> (<i>g</i>).&mdash;A method of putting ink on paper through the
process of chemical or surface printing, rather than through the process
of relief or impressional printing. It is based, like lithography, upon
the principle that oil and water will not mix. The design is transferred
to a thin zinc or aluminum plate, which takes the place of the stone in
lithography. The transfer ink is of a greasy consistency, having an
affinity for zinc or aluminum, and a repellent attitude toward water.
In the operation of the press, the plate is clamped around the cylinder,
and two sets of rollers pass over it. The first set is moistened with
water, and its function is to dampen the entire surface of the plate except
where the design appears, the greasy consistency of which repels
the water. Inking rollers pass over the plate immediately following the
water rollers. The dampness on all parts of the plate except at the
design points repels the greasy consistency of the ink, and allows a
deposit of surplus ink upon the design, due to the similar consistency
of the two ingredients. The design is then printed onto a rubber
blanket, which is clamped around a second cylinder, and is reprinted
or "offset" onto the paper, which passes between this second cylinder
and a third cylinder.</p>

of the picture on the surface, instead of in relief with the whites
etched down below the surface. The term "photogravure"
is applied to a similar engraving in which the effects of light and
shade are produced not by dots and stipples produced through
a halftone screen, but by variations in depth of the depressions
in the form of grain. In printing these plates the ink is run
into the depressions, and the surface then wiped clean before
being impressed upon the paper.</p>

the family name. The reasons for entry under the
title are that British noblemen are always so spoken of,
and always sign by their titles only. The reasons
against it are that the founders of noble families are
often as well known&mdash;sometimes even better&mdash;by
their family name as by their titles (e.g., <i>Charles Jenkinson</i>
afterwards <i>Lord Liverpool</i>, <i>Sir Robert Walpole</i>,
afterwards <i>Earl of Oxford</i>); that the same man bears
different titles in different parts of his life thus Philip
Stanhope published his "History of England from the
Peace of Utrecht" as Lord Mahon, and his "Reign of
Queen Anne" as Earl Stanhope; that it separates
members of the same family (Lord Chancellor Eldon
would be under <i>Eldon</i> and his father and all his brothers
and sisters under the family name <i>Scott</i>), and brings
together members of different families (thus the earldom
of Bath has been held by members of the families
of Shaunde, Bourchier, Granville, and Pulteney, and
the family name of the present Marquis of Bath is
Thynne), which last argument would be more to the
point in planning a family history. The same objections
apply to the entry of French noblemen under
their titles, about which there can be no hesitation.
The strongest argument in favor of the Museum rule
is that it is well-established, and that it is desirable
that there should be some uniform rule.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
